7,"14 years later, Norv Turner's prediction of Jimmy Johnson being a Hall of Famer came true","During Troy Aikman's Hall of Fame enshrinement back in 2006, Norv Turner was the guy to present him. After a genuine and heartfelt speech about Troy's abilities and character, he capped it with the following paragraph:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I feel privileged to present Troy today. But I feel more privileged to have been his close friend throughout the years.  Troy's teammates would tell you he was a leader of those great Dallas teams of the '90s. It's fitting that he's the first of that group to enter the Hall of Fame. \*\*I look forward to future years when he'll be joined by his great coach Jimmy Johnson\*\*, his teammates Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith, Larry Allen and hopefully others. ""

\&gt;  It's a great honor and thrill to present to the Hall of Fame, Dallas quarterback, No. 8, Troy Aikman.  \[source\]([https://www.profootballhof.com/players/troy-aikman/enshrinement/](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/troy-aikman/enshrinement/))

22,In defence of the 4th and 1 sneak against the Bills,"I know most of you have already move on to trashing BoB for his 4th down fake punt, and honestly that play is so indefensible that there is no point of even attempting to say anything co-coherent about it.

However, in the wake of that decision, people are piling onto the 4th and 1 sneak attempt from the previous week and I still think that was the correct call, to prove that point lets look at some of the math. First we have to set the scene.

1:21 left, the Texans are up 3 points, the Bills have no timeouts, a 1st down ends the game.

+ The Texans had 15 4th and 1s on the year.
 + 3 Punts;
 + 2 Turnover on Downs;
 + 1 Interception; and
 + 9 First Downs
+ The Bills faced 9 4th and 1s on the year,
 + 1 Punt;
 + 4 Turnover on Downs; and
 + 4 1st Downs
+ The field goal would have been a 49 yard field goal (Ball was at the 31)
 + Fairbairn is about an average kicker nothing special nothing terrible, he is 7/12 from beyond 40 this year but that's helped out by two long 50s misses, the league average for 47-50 yard field goals was 68.2% which seems like a fair number for him.

As you can see, the chance of making the FG and getting the 1st down are pretty close to each other, however the sneak ends the game with a success and the missed FG gives up an extra 8 yards of field position, bring the Bills even that much closer to a FG

I think why so many fans missed on this is they assume that kickers are virtually automatic and it was a guaranteed 3 points, however I trust a mobile QB like Watson to get a 4th and 1 sneak more consistently than a kicker like Fairbairn hitting a high pressure high 40s kick",nfl,WasV3,11,2020-01-12
23,"With Jimmy Johnson's induction into the HOF, 8 of the 13 coaches with 2+ Super Bowl rings are in","There are still five multi-time Super Bowl winners outside of the hall.   Bill Belichick will obviously get in once he's done, but the other four are fascinating cases, especially when you compare their accolades to Johnson and Bill Cowher

Tom Coughlin: 20 years as a HC between the Giants and Jaguars,  170-150 regular season record (.531%), 12-7 in playoffs, 2 titles with NYG

Mike Shanahan: 20 years, most notably with the Broncos but also stints with Washington and the Raiders.  170-138 (.552%), 8-6 in playoffs, two titles with DEN

George Seifert: 11 years between the 49ers and Panthers, 114-62 (.648%), 10-5 in playoffs, two titles with SF

Tom Flores: 12 years between Raiders and Seahawks, 97-87 (.527%), 8-3 in playoffs, two titles with Raiders

Obviously Coughlin and Shanahan are more recent retirees relatively so they both could get in down the line (Cowher waited 14 years, Johnson 21 years).

Also, Cowher will be one of seven HOF coaches with only one or zero league titles.  Tony Dungy and John Madden each made it to and won one Super Bowl and Sid Gillman has an AFL title.

53,Why is the draft value relative to draft position so different in the NFL than it is the NBA?,"I first wondered this when looking at the New Orleans Saints. They drafted Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, two of their offenses most important players (Kamara less so this season) in the second and third round. All across the league you see second, third, all the way to sixth round picks coming in and being instant contributors and in some cases even stars. 

In the NBA however, that level of value from even a late first round pick outside of the lottery is so much less likely. Most of the real impact players are already out of the draft after the lottery with the exception of the occasional extremely deep draft or in the case of a Brandon Clarke for example just a selection of teams whiffing on picks. The amount of second round draft picks in the NBA that have panned out is tiny compared to the amount of non first rounders that become top players or contributors in the NFL.

Why do you think this is? Is it maybe because the one and done nature of much of college basketball means players that have had more development are overlooked in favour of high upside youngsters that may not pan out? Are NFL scouts just worse at predicting who is a first round level talent? Or does the NFL draft system simply value picking for need over best available significantly more than the NBA model? 

I'd be interesting to hear opinions on this.",nfl,Aussiefgt,97,2020-01-13

85,Ryan Tannehill contract,"Hey guys, i'm not a Titans fan, however, I love good football and am curious to what eeryone else thinks he will make next year.

Anyways, i'm talking about Ryan Tannehill. He was apart of, imo, the Dolphins getting rid of their best players over the last 2 years, Jarvis Landry, Ryan Tannehill, Kenyan Drake, Larmey Tunsil, Minkah Fitzpatrick and Dion Jordon (even though that was mainly off field). 4 of those were 1st RD picks. Most teams retain their players like that. Anyways my point is I am looking at some numbers and watching highlights and am curious as to what Ryan Tannehil's contract will look like.

In 2019 he came in to backup Mariota, he ended up taking the job and running with it and started 10 and played in 11 games (techniccly 12, but he was just in for a gadget play in one of those games) and he threw for 2,742 yards, 22 TD's and only 6 interceptions. While adding 185 yards and 4 TD's on the ground on his way to helping lead the Titans to the playoffs. I did the math and if he started every game he was on a pace for roughly 4,300 yards, 33 Td's and 9 or 10 interceptions and adding rougly 300 yards and 6 rushing TD's and I guess you can say he also led his team to the playoffs.

My main thing is, idk what his contract will look like, I know he will get a big one, even if they don't win the AFC championship game or Super Bowl. Because he already won 2 playoff games. However if he wins any more games, his price goes up ALOT for each game. I know stats don,t matter, however, they matter alot in contract talks, lol. And thats where IDK what a contract for Tannehill would look like considering even though he's won 2 playoff games. He hasn't thrown over 100 yards in either of those, but he has accounted for 4 TD's and only 1 interception.

Anyways, I personally have no clue what it will look like. That's why i'm making this post. Any feedback would be awesome. I know there are still games to be played, however i'm already looking ahead to Tannehill's future. I was a fan of him, and had a few really good seasons with the Dolphins, and looked like a franchise QB at times imo. I personally think there just wasn't enough talent around him, however, he's been given another shot at a huge contract.

DeShaun Watson doesn't have the same level of individual accolades as Lamar, but he's definitely showed out in more big games over his career compared to Lamar. 

Overall I'd say the stats clearly point to Lamar, but stats are also pretty meaningless when it comes down to the shit. If it were up to me personally I'd take Watson just because he's a more talented thrower and I just trust him more when it actually matters.

Anyway she mentioned it last night and I turned it on, interested as to what she was talking about. As I watched, I finally understood. It was exhilarating! I loved the team spirit and the strategy, I found myself yelling at the screen, exclaiming to myself “WOW! What was that!” I had no idea what was happening when that coach heard he was going to be inducted in the hall of fame, it touched my heart and damn if I didn’t tear up listening to him speak about the game and work he was so passionate about.

I think I’ll really like this! No one in my family watches it, and I don’t really have anyone but that one friend to talk to about football, but I was wondering if anyone could give me some pointers as a new fan?

156,Someone explain to me why the Texans going for a fake punt in yesterday's game was a bad idea.,"In hindsight, we now know what BOB knew during the game, which is, his defense can't stop the Chiefs at all. Like, at all. So, if you can't stop them then the only way you have to win is to score and/or keep them off the field as much as you can. 

So, unless you want to just keep the offense out there for a 4th and 5 you can be tricky and go for the fake punt.

I just don't understand the logic behind people saying this was a bad playcall. If you punt it they still score, you've maybe given them 2 extra minutes on the clock saved if you don't get it. If you do get it then probably you get a couple first downs, maybe you dont score but you take 3 or so minutes off the clock.

168,[OC] Four teams remain. Here's the storyline for each if they win it all.,"This was inspired after reading u/OnlyFan's ""storyline if each AFC team won it all"" post. I was hoping he would do the NFC as well but I might have missed it. In any case, the divisional round has happened and the last four teams have been decided.

49ers:

Stepping out of his dad's shadow, Kyle Shanahan proves the regular season wasn't a fluke and wins his first ring as a head coach, solidifying a position among the current HC elites. The decision to go get Jimmy G from the Patriots is vindicated, and the Niners elite defense reinforces the motto that it is defense, not offense, that wins championships: this defense will have beaten Kirk Cousins (who in turn beat the Saints), Aaron Rodgers, and either Patrick Mahomes or the revived Tannehill on the Titans. Richard Sherman might be spotted on TMZ being outspoken/trash talking once more, but in the wake of winning a ring, few can blame him. He, Jimmy G, and Shanahan, along with several other defensive players, are all immortalized throughout Levi's Stadium, either with statues or murals. The Bay Area parties for a week; the Warriors and Giants might not be doing so great anymore, but the future is bright for San Francisco.

Packers:

Five years from now, half of the newer HCs in the league will be looking at the story of Matt LaFleur. In his very first year leading his own team, he took a squad that had previously been struggling with playoff games and in danger of missing them entirely in the foreseeable future to it's second championship of the new millennia. Like McVay before him, his assistants are at the top of the list for numerous openings throughout the NFL. Aaron Rodgers gets a statue built of him in Lambeau, all but guarantees his place in the Hall of Fame, and wins his second ring, and now instead of saying ""he only has one ring to Brady's six"", Patriots fans instead say, ""he only has two rings to Brady's six"". Wisconsin nearly experiences a cheese shortage as the stuff becomes widely consumed in the wake of the the victory of the Cheeseheads. If Giannis and the Bucks also win a ring, 2020 will go down in history as Wisconsin's year.

Chiefs:

Andy Reid finally gets past the hump of ""very good coach"" to ""elite coach"" with his first SB win as a HC. He secures his position as a Hall of Famer and gets lifetime discounts at every KC barbecue joint. Patrick Mahomes is unofficially crowned as the greatest QB of the new generation, after racking up an MVP award and a ring in under four years. Both of them get statues at Arrowhead as Kansas City celebrates it's first Super Bowl in fifty years, defeating the Deshaun Watson led Texans in a comeback win, avoiding a trap game against the Titans, and defeating one of the top two teams in the NFC. The victory parade consists of tons of ketchup and KC barbecue as the rest of the AFC West looks on in dismay, having to play in a division with Mahomes for probably the next decade.

Titans:

This is one for the ages. In one of the most unexpected playoff runs in the history of the NFL, the Titans go from barely sneaking in to winning it all. Along they way, they defeated Brady and the Patriots at home, the Lamar Jackson led Ravens, the Mahomes led Chiefs, and in Miami either the elite defense of the Niners or Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. Vrabel, Tannehill, and Henry get all the Southern comfort food and Jack Daniels they want before the city of Nashville hands them the keys to the city and builds a collective statue of the trio outside Nissan Stadium. The Texans realize that winning the AFC South is no longer a given, the Colts start praying Tua or Trevor Lawrence falls in their lap somehow, and the Jaguars are in shambles as the division just got even harder to win.",nfl,Jokerang,182,2020-01-13

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see in this chart, including the Ravens QB, **there have been 14 MVPs to lose in the first playoff game of that season.** Lamar's performance in said playoff game, like most of the other MVP performances listed, does not necessarily look terrible, much more like a step down from the level of play we expect after such a great season. It's certainly not as atrocious as Brian Sipe's 17.0 rated choke, yet it isn't quite as admirable as LT's 200 yard, 2 TD game. 

As for the future of these players, out of the previous 13, **6 did not return to the postseason the next year,** but, only Brian Sipe and Barry Sanders would never return for the remainder of their career. Out of the 11 that did return to the postseason, only Bert Jones and AP would never win a postseason game for the rest of their career. Out of the 9 players who did get another postseason win, **6 of them would win the very next year, and all of those 6 won at least 2 games.** Of those 6, Manning, Brady, Faulk, and Tarkenton would make it to the Super Bowl the next year.

In short, Lamar may have choked, but this loss, as shocking as it is, puts him in good company, and there's a strong chance he can come back with a vengeance too.",nfl,iCE_P0W3R,72,2020-01-13

195,"Atwater's iconic hit on Okoye, and contextualized to the missed opportunity of Earl Thomas vs Derrick Henry","The league is in awe of Derrick Henry and his powerful yet surprisingly fast running style. Those who are old enough are probably not witnessing this for the first time, though, as you might remember a similar force of nature who graced the NFL, one Christian Okoye, aka the Nigerian Nightmare.

Christian Okoye is listed in PFR at [6'1"", 253 lbs](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/O/OkoyCh00.htm) but was [between 255 and 260 lbs at the time in question]](https://mobile.twitter.com/AllbrightNFL/status/1212894284933787648). He ran a [4.4 sec 40 yard dash](https://people.com/archive/we-kid-you-not-kansas-city-rookie-christian-okoye-is-powered-by-goodness-and-goat-meat-vol-28-no-22/) [(4.44 sec according to Okoye himself.)](https://mobile.twitter.com/BrandonSpano/status/1213149085097611264)

Okoye entered the league in 1987 but fully came into his own in the 1989 season, when he won the rushing title with 1,480 yards, led the league in rushing attempts at 370, tied for the longest rush, and collected 12 TDs on his way to a Pro Bowl and being named 1st team All Pro. 

In the second week of the subsequent season, Sept. 17, 1990, the Chiefs faced the Broncos at Mile High. Enter one Steve Atwater, Free Safety for the Denver Broncos, aka the Smilin' Assassin. Though a shy man off the field, his hitting was so loud on the field that other teams schemed their offenses to keep their players away from him. He was [6'3""](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AtwaSt00.htm) and weighed [212 lbs at the time](https://mobile.twitter.com/AllbrightNFL/status/1212894284933787648). That's 17-18% lighter than Okoye.

On the [play in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=43&amp;v=90HMXA5I2Tk&amp;feature=emb_title), Okoye had [at least 7 yards](https://youtu.be/fvPxzQBIafo?t=12) but probably closer to 9 or 10 yards to accelerate through a gaping hole in the line. That's when Atwater met him head-on (though head-up, arms and shoulder leading) in the gap. Atwater sent Okoye backwards, and Okoye's psychological reign of terror over the league was effectively ended. (Of course Atwater's psychological reign of terror only gained, err, momentum.) The Broncos would win that game, though just one of 5 that season that saw Denver last in the then 5 team AFC West. And while Okoye did not disappear from the league, he was never able to achieve the same success he'd had in '89, and he never put up great numbers vs the Broncos for the rest of his career.

By comparison, Derrick Henry is listed at [6'3"", 247 lbs and ran a 4.54 40.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HenrDe00.htm). Of course 40 times aren't everything, but the comparison should be clear that Okoye might well have been both heavier and faster than Henry. At 18% lighter than Henry is, for example, Earl Thomas, listed at [5'10"", 202 lbs](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/ThomEa99.htm).

For purposes of hitting, what ""matters"" is that a hit changes a runner's velocity in some short interval of time. The force applied is the change of momentum (the runner's velocity times his mass) divided by the time it takes to impart that change.

It's reasonable to think that Earl Thomas could have faced down Henry in a nearly identical situation as Atwater faced down Okoye. But as it turns out, and despite indications from Thomas that the Ravens wouldn't shy from contact with Henry, Henry's reign of terror over the NFL continues into Kansas City next week.

(This message is brought to you by Atwater for Hall of Fame, a not-for-profit organization. Thanks to Allbright for inspiring the comparison, though I hope I got the physics better and the analogous defender more relevant to January, 2020 football. If I got any details wrong, please comment and I'll update accordingly.)",nfl,blewrb,60,2020-01-13

272,How do Cowher and Johnson stack up to the previous 23 coaches to make the Hall of Fame?,"The Pro Football Hall of Fame is a prestigious achievement with few members. How do Jimmy Johnson and Bill Cowher stack up to the previous 23 inductees?

Jimmy Johnson had 9 seasons, a win loss record of 80-64 (56%), made the playoffs 6 times and won 2 super bowls.

Bill Cowher had 15 years, a record of 149-90 (62%), made the playoffs 10 times and won 1 super bowl.

With only 23 coaches in the hall of fame, it might not shock you that some of their numbers are out of this world. Don Shula has the most wins, with **328 wins to 156 losses**. Among the HoF coaches, Cowher comes in at 11, behind Steve Owen, Joe Gibbs, and Bud Grant. He has more wins than Tony Dungy and Marv Levy.

Jimmy Johnson does not rank nearly as highly among HoF coaches, with his 80 wins coming in tied for 3rd -fewest with Ray Flaherty, ahead of Greasy Neale and Guy Chamberlin. You may not know these fellows, as Ray Flaherty was the most recent inductee in 1976. He won 80 games with 37 losses in 11 seasons. He was also a 3 time All-Pro as a DE, and the first professional athlete to have his number retired. Greasy Neale also had a brief pro career as a player in football, after playing baseball from 1916-1924. He had a very nice career and played well in the famous 1919 WS. As an NFL coach, he had 63 wins and 43 losses (59%) in 10 seasons, made the NFL championship game 3 times and twice being NFL champion. In his 10 year career as a coach, he had 2 losing seasons. Guy Chamberlin was another player and coach. In fact, he was a player coach and won All Pro honors while winning back to back championships as a player coach. He even led his team in scoring while playing every minute of a 13 game season. Yes- he played offense, defense, and coached. He was a 5 time champion between 1291 and 1926.

Jimmy Johnson's career is also kind of a weird one. It's extremely short - 9 seasons. The other coaches with such few games in the HoF were from a long time ago, when there were fewer games in a season, were also players, or had an enormous impact on the game (Bill Walsh, for example, has 92 wins but was a first ballot HoF). Jimmy Johnson is similarly getting in for impact on the game outside of the win loss column. His draft value chart and his work on TV/staying relevant has undoubtedly helped his campaign. John Madden is another coach who did not deserve to be in the HoF strictly on his coaching record.

Another coach who is waiting to get in but will likely not after another snub is Tom Flores. He's one of the 2 Super Bowl win club that had not made the HoF, along with Jimmy Johnson until this year. Other members include George Seifert (2 SBs as HC, 114-62, 65%), Mike Shanahan (2 SBs as HC, 170-138, 55%), and Tom Coughlin (2 SBs as HC, 170-150, 53%).",nfl,DeanBlandino,48,2020-01-13

If you're going to gain between 10-12 yards and barely get a first down why not train your players to go down short of the marker by a yard? I'll take 2nd and 1's all day long. (This doesn't apply if a player knows they are going to break a play for more than 15 yards. I'm only talking about when they know they will barely make the first down.

Disclaimer: this doesn’t include Conference Championships that went into overtime and the result of the subsequent Super Bowl. 

*2011 season playoffs*

- **DEN 29** - 23 PIT (OT) in Wildcard Round
- DEN 10 - **45 NE** in Divisional Round 

*2012 season playoffs*

- **BAL 38** - 35 DEN (2OT) in Divisional Round

- ARI 15 - **49 CAR** in Conference Championship

*2019 season playoffs*

- **HOU 22** - 19 BUF (OT) in Wildcard Round
- HOU 31 - **51 KC** in Divisional Round

- **MIN 26** - 20 NO (OT) in Wildcard Round
- MIN 10 - **27 SF** in Divisional Round

Some noteworthy facts:

In the 4 losses, the average margin of loss was a whopping 26.5 points. If the Baltimore win is included, the OT-winning team lost by an average margin 18.2 points. 

In 3 of the 4 losses, the opposing team had a bye the previous week in the Wildcard Round. 

In the only instance of a team winning an OT playoff game and then the game in the following week, the team (Baltimore) went on to win the Super Bowl. 

In Conference Championship games that went to overtime, the winner is 2-2 in the ensuing Super Bowl. (Two of these four games happened last year when the two overtime winners of the CCGs faced each other in Super Bowl 53).

This is too low of a sample size and too high variance of a sport to make sweeping conclusions/generalizations about the overtime rules or about the effects of the added physical toll of playing in overtime. For example, in the DEN vs PIT OT game, there was only one play in overtime, so the added physical toll is negligible.

If you were one of the people that turned off Sundays contest between the Texans and Chiefs you are probably regretting that decision right now. What Houston accomplished in the first quarter was historic. What the Chiefs did after that was even more historic – if that makes sense. 

Houston started the game hot. After gaining 21 Yards on their first five plays Bill O’Brien decided to gamble on third and one. Coaches always preach that you have to make big decision in big games. Good placalling is playing with and defying expectations. O’Brien did just that, using his own playcalling tendencies – and those of pretty much every other NFL coach – to his advantage. The Screen is one of the most popular playcalls on short yardage situations in todays NFL, because it renders Blitzes and pressure on the QB essentially useless. Iinstead it relies on your receivers making people miss in open space. 

Screens are primarily run out of bunch formations these days, because pass defenders often give a cushion of a few yards to these formations. This effect occurs due to the respect they have to pay to possible rub concepts. Defenders in man coverage struggle to defend those route combinations because they have to either pass of their designated pass catcher or run into either the other pass catcher that crosses ways with him on a crossing route, or their own teammate that is trailing said pass catcher.

Coming back to my point: Great playcalling is playing with expectations. Looking at the context given and the situation being a third and one – one drop away from being forced to punt – you might see why #35 Charvarious Ward expects the screen and bites hard, in turn abandoning #12 Kenny Stills, whom he expects to merely be a blocker. Instead Stills turns on the burners and uses his 4.38 40-speed to leave the entire Kansas City secondary in the dust and walk in untouched for the TD.

With the momentum on their side the Houston defense subsequentially rallies to force a three and out. Patrick Mahomes and his normally so dominant offense can’t seem to find their groove. It doesn’t get better from there. Houstons Barkevious Mingo beats his blocker on the ensuing punt and comes barreling down the middle to block Colquitts punt attempt which Lonnie Johnson scoops up and takes into the Endzone. It’s 14:0 after less than five minutes. The 76.000 Kansas fans are stunned.

But Kansas City won’t go down without a fight. 22 Yards on the first three plays of the next drive seem to say that not all hope is lost. Two uncharacteristic drops and a 5 Yard gain later however - and Colquitt lines up to punt again. Two drives result in a grand total of 46 Yards gained. The first boos can be heard in Arrowhead. Now it’s Houstons turn with the ball again, but the KC defense forces the much-needed stop after a Frank Clark sack results in a five Yards loss for Deshaun Watson. Houston lines up to punt. The returner is Tyreek Hill, one of the fastest men in the league and KCs star wide receiver. With their backs already to the wall, the Chiefs are looking desparately for a spark to turn the momentum back around. Tyreek Hill however lets the ball slip through his extended arms and muffs the punt. Houston recovers. The spark the Chiefs needed ony fans the flames that is the Houston special teams today. 

Starting at the Chiefs six yard line the rest is easy work for Deshaun Watson. Only two plays later and Watson nails a four yard pass to Darren Fells sitting down in between the zones. A succesfull extra point later and its 21:0. After less than one quarter. Bad things turn worse as Damien Williams and Demarcus Robinson drop two passes and KC is forced to punt after going three and out. Again. A quarter characterized by drops and special teams blunders ends shortly after. Houston is still driving the ball at the beginning of the second quarter and extends their lead to 24:0 on a 31-yard Field Goal.

Facing one of the largest deficits ever in the first quarter of a playoff game, Patrick Mahomes and his squad have to accomplish something truly special to turn this game around. The spark they missed out on just a quarter earlier comes in form of Mecole Hardman. The rookie returns the kickoff after the Houston Field Goal for 58 yards all the way to the Houston 42. Patrick Mahomes is back on the turf - with excellent field position. Finally something is going right for the Chiefs. On the first play of the drive star Tight End Travis Kelce takes the responsibility on his shoulders and comes down with a huge catch for 25 Yards. On the next play Patrick Mahomes hits Damien Williams in stride on a wheel route who walks in for the 17 yard Touchdown. Arrowhead explodes. The Chiefs are on the board.

Big decisions in big games, remember? On the ensuing drive Bill O’Brien sticks to what seems to be his mantra and calls a questionable fake punt on 4th and four from his own 31 Yard-line – while being up by 17 points. Daniel Sorensen sniffs it out and tackles J. Reid short of the line to gain. By now all of Houstons momentum has evaporated and the Chiefs wont take their foot of the gas pedal. Three plays, a 23 second Touchdown by Kelce, and a Houston fumble on the following punt return later, and the Chiefs are on the field again. This time its Patrick Mahomes turn to start at the opponents 6-Yard line. What follows are another three plays and another Kelce touchdown. Suddenly this game is wide open, all that separates the two AFC-Contenders are 3 points and there are still six and a half minutes to play in the second quarter. A quick stop and the Chiefs offense might even the see the field again before the half.

That is exactly what happens as Houston shows nerves by nearly fumbling the ball on a lateral and almost giving up  another turnover. Faced with a 4th and 12 Houston is forced to punt once again. The Chiefs offense takes the field and Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid execute a nearly perfect two-minute-drill to close out their half with another Touchdown. What noone believed possible happened. Somehow Kansas City scored even more points in the second quarter than Houston did in their ridiculous first period. The score is 24:28 in favor of Kansas City. 

As if 52 points in a half weren’t enough, Houston still gets another chance to score. But Ka’imi Fairbairn misses the 51- Field Goal attempt as the clock expires. It’s Halftime.

Houston fails to adjust in the second half and from there on out its exclusively the Chiefs game as Houston scores only seven points in the rest of the game after scoring 21 in the first quarter alone. The Chiefs however drive down the field seemingly at will and score 23 more points to end the game with a decisive score of 51-31. Since falling behind 24-0 the Chiefs scored on their next seven drives to put the game out of reach for Houston.",nfl,Hamsterdumm,6,2020-01-13

396,The playoff runs of all teams that never made the Super Bowl (in the Super Bowl era),"We're not going to see a new team in the Super Bowl this year thanks to the Texans being eliminated yesterday. So let's honor the playoff runs of all NFL teams that never made the Super Bowl.

**Houston Texans**:

* **2011**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Bengals, 31-10 W)**: a very strong way to start their first playoff appearance, even if the Bengals were just a 6-seed. Houston trailed a few times in the first half but held the Bengals scoreless in the second half en route to a dominant victory.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Ravens, 20-13 L)**: the Texans burned themselves with an awful first-quarter, giving up 17 points to Baltimore. TJ Yates had a 3 INT game and despite Arian Foster's performance, Houston could only get 10 points back in the 2nd and was held scoreless in the second half. The game was close, but Houston shot themselves in the foot too many times.
* **2012**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Bengals, 19-13 W)**: the game wasn't really as close as the score indicated, as the Texans D performed superbly in holding Cincinnati's offense scoreless throughout the game. Their offense could only convert 1 TD in the game which kept the Bengals in the game throughout, but their performance was enough to give the Texans another playoff victory in 2 years.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Patriots, 41-28 L)**: the Texans kept the game close in the 1st half, as they trailed just 17-13, but they doomed themselves by giving up three unanswered through the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters. They responded with 2 TDs to pull within 10, but that was as close as they would get.
* **2015**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Chiefs, 30-0 L)**: after 2 straight seasons of missing the playoffs, the Texans made it back only to get curb-stomped at home in a snoozefest of a game. Knile Davis returned the opening kickoff 106 yards for the score and the Chiefs never looked back. KC was aided by Brian Hoyer's 5-turnover game which included 4 INTs (and 1 fumble).
* **2016**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Raiders, 27-14 W)**: a solid victory by the Texans, though this game was pretty much a gimme as the Raiders had to play with a backup QB who had just 1 NFL start prior. Credit still to Houston for not squandering this opportunity, at one point leading 27-7.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Patriots, 34-16 L)**: I don't like to use the term ""real team"", but I will say this: the Texans lost facing their first ""100% team"" in this year's playoffs, although they did put up a good fight against the 1-seed. As with their previous matchup, Houston kept things close in the first half, trailing just 17-13 after it ended. Houston would fare better in this matchup, trailing just 24-16 in the fourth, but then gave up 10 unanswered points to put the game away.
* **2018**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Colts, 21-7 L)**: the Texans had a major playoff hangover in this game, as they gave up 21 first-half points and didn't score until the fourth quarter. It wasn't a great way to avenge their earlier 24-21 loss–also at home–against Indianapolis and they were pretty much completely dominated by Indy's D.
* **2019**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Bills, 22-19 W, OT)**: this was a great game where the Texans pulled off a 16-point comeback and won the game on a FG in OT thanks to clutch play. Deshaun Watson was 20/25 for 247 yards and the Texans defense came up huge in the second half (also aided by sloppy Buffalo play).
   * **Divisional Round (@ Chiefs, 51-31 L)**: the Texans then proceeded to embarrass themselves in the Divisional Round–again–as they not only blew a 24 point lead but allowed themselves to get outscored 51-7 after the first quarter. The pass defense, in particular, was awful as opposing QB Patrick Mahomes threw for 321 yards and 5 TDs. There was also extremely sloppy playcalling on Houston's part which contributed to their demise.

**Cleveland Browns (new iteration)**:

* **2002**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Steelers, 36-33 L)**: in typical Browns fashion, Cleveland had a 27-14 lead early in the 4th quarter and a 33-21 lead with just over 10 minutes remaining and completely blew it in this iteration's only playoff appearance to this day, giving Pittsburgh a 36-33 lead on 15 unanswered points including a TD with 54 seconds left (also, Pittsburgh's first lead of the game, go figure). To add insult to the injury, Cleveland's drive got them to the Pittsburgh 29 to set up what would be a makeable FG to tie the game, but they couldn't get out of bounds, were out of timeouts, and there simply wasn't enough time to get the kicking unit on the field.

**Jacksonville Jaguars**:

* **1996**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Bills, 30-27 W)**: in just their second season, the Jags got their first playoff win in their first appearance as they scored 10 points in the decisive fourth quarter to take the lead for good. Buffalo had a chance but Jacksonville forced a fumble on the Bills' final offensive drive to seal the victory.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Broncos, 30-27 W)**: the Jaguars would continue their Cinderella march as they defeated the Broncos in the next round led by Brunell's 2 TDs, including a key pass to Jimmy Smith late in the fourth that would give the Jags a 30-20 lead after the XP attempt. This was crucial as Denver would score a TD with under a minute to play, but Jacksonville recovered the onside kick and won the game.
   * **AFC Championship (@ Patriots, 20-6 L)**: unfortunately, the Jags' playoff run would end on a whimper as their offense sputtered throughout the game and the Pats offense was good enough to win the game for New England. It didn't help that the Jags had 4 turnovers that game.
* **1997**: 
   * **Wild Card (@ Broncos, 42-17 L)**: the Jags allowed the Broncos to get revenge in their playoff matchup the next year as they allowed 184 yards from opposing RB Terrelle Davis and Mark Brunell had a shaky game which included an interception and just 18/32 on completions. True, the Jags trailed just 21-17 after the third, but they allowed Denver to score 3 unanswered TDs in the fourth to seal the loss.
* **1998**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Patriots, 25-10 W)**: the Jags offense had to settle for FGs throughout the day (5 compared to just 1 TD), but that was enough for a solid victory over NE as the Jags defense held the Pats to just 203 yards and forced 3 turnovers. It wasn't the prettiest win, a but a win is a win.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Jets, 34-24 L)**: Brunell had an awful game as he was just 12/31 with 3 INTs on the day despite 3 TDs. The Jags would make it a 1 TD game at one point, but the Jets kicked a late FG to put the game away for good.
* **1999**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Dolphins, 62-7 W)**: at one point, the Jags led 41-0 and never looked back. This game is infamous for being Dan Marino's awful last hurrah, as he completed just 11/25 passes for a meager 95 yards. In contrast, the Jags had not 1 but 2 passers throw for more than 100 yards. To date, the Jags hold the record for the most points scored by a single team in an NFL playoff game in the Super Bowl era.
   * **Divisional Round (vs Titans, 33-14 L)**: the Jags got off to a 14-10 lead at halftime, but their offense completely vanished in the second half as they allowed Tennessee to score 23 unanswered points. Jacksonville had 6 turnovers which didn't help at all.
* **2005**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Patriots, 28-3 L)**: the Jags actually trailed just 7-3 at the half, but the rest of the game would be a snoozefest as their offense again disappeared in the second half, allowing 21 straight points to the Pats. Byron Leftwich, Jacksonville's QB, was the Jags' leading rusher...with 26 yards. Yeah, that sucked. Add a pick-6 in the fourth quarter to increase the misery.
* **2007**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Steelers, 31-29 W)**: in an inspiring victory, the Jags led 28-10 at one point and although they would blow the lead and trail 29-28 late in the fourth, David Garrard would lead a game-winning drive which ended in a FG with 37 seconds remaining. The Jaguars would force a fumble on the Steelers' ensuing drive to win.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Patriots, 31-20 L)**: the Jags kept up with the Patriots for most of the game and at one point trailing just 28-20 in the fourth, but that would be the closest the Jags would get as the Patriots would add a dagger FG and hold the Jags scoreless for the rest of the game. It was a tall order ending the Pats' unbeaten streak, but it was still a deflating way to go out.
* **2017**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Bills, 10-3 W)**: this was a sloppy offensive game on so many levels, but the Jags got the only TD of the game in the third to put them ahead 10-3, and their defense held on to win the low-scoring affair and give the Jags their first playoff win in 10 years.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Steelers, 45-42 W)**: this game really wasn't as close as the score indicated, as the Jags offense was on fire for the entirety of the game. At one point, they led 21-0, and while the Steelers made things close in the 4th, the Jags held a comfortable 45-35 lead which was only negated when Pittsburgh scored a TD with just 1 second remaining, the game well in the winning books for Jacksonville at that point.
   * **AFC Championship (@ Patriots, 24-20 L)**: in a heartbreaking game for Jacksonville, the Jags blew a 20-10 lead with under 10 minutes remaining, including a NE touchdown with 2:48 on the clock. The ensuing Jacksonville drive went 4th-and-out, and the Patriots kneeled the game away to prevent the Jags from reaching the Super Bowl in their closest attempt to this day.

**Cleveland Browns (old iteration)**:

* **1967:**
   * **Eastern Conference Championship (@ Cowboys, 52-14 L)**: Dallas led 52-7 at one point and the Browns were simply overmatched the entire game. Add a pick-6 to add injury to the insult for Cleveland fans. Their first playoff appearance in the Super Bowl era was a forgettable one.
* **1968**:
   * **Eastern Conference Championship (vs Cowboys, 31-20 W)**: the Browns got revenge from last season's conference championship in taking care of business vs Dallas this time around. At one point, Cleveland led 31-13 and Cleveland had a pretty comfortable path to victory in this one.
   * **NFL Championship (@ Colts, 34-0 L)**: unfortunately, Cleveland's playoff run ended abruptly with a shutout loss in the NFL championship to Baltimore. The Colts turned up the heat in the second quarter and never cooled off as Cleveland's offense went completely silent.
* **1969**:
   * **Eastern Conference Championship (@ Cowboys, 38-14 W)**: the Browns would once again defeat the Cowboys as RB Bo Scott scored 2 TDs and the Cleveland defense held Dallas scoreless in the first half.
   * **NFL Championship (@ Vikings, 27-7 L)**: again, the Browns would get completely demolished in the NFL championship, managing just a late TD vs Minnesota while the Vikings kept the heat on all game. In two back-to-back NFL championships, the Browns managed just 7 points. Oof.
* **1971**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Colts, 20-3 L)**: the Browns were undone by Bill Nelsen's 3 INT game and the Colts defense completely stuffed Cleveland throughout the game, their offense managing just enough points to knock the Browns out from the playoffs.
* **1972**:
   * **Divisional Round (@ Dolphins, 20-14 L)**: in a tightly contested affair, the Browns allowed a late TD to Miami on a Jim Hiick TD run to give up a 14-13 lead and squander yet another divisional round, this time in more heartbreaking fashion.
* **1980**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Raiders, 14-12 L)**: the Raiders scored a TD in the fourth quarter to take a 14-12 lead, but this game is more heartbreaking due to the Red Right 88 play that saw Ozzie Newsome's pass get blown into Mike Davis' hands for the game-losing INT...when the Browns were in near-automatic FG range that could've given them an easy victory...
* **1982**:
   * **First Round (@ Raiders, 27-10 L)**: in a rematch from two seasons ago, the Browns trailed just 13-10 at the half but then were held scoreless throughout the second half. They allowed opposing QB Jim Plunkett to pass for 386 yards which contributed to yet another opening-round loss for Cleveland.
* **1985**:
   * **Divisional Round (@ Dolphins, 24-21 L)**: entering the 4th quarter, the Browns had a 21-17 lead, but they gave it back as they allowed a TD-drive which ended in a Ron Davenport rushing TD. Oh yeah, and Dan Marino passed for 238 yards and 1 TD in the game as well. The Browns fell out in the divisional round yet again.
* **1986**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Jets, 23-20 W, 2OT)**: the Browns would tie the game late in the 4th on a 22-yard FG, then in a very sloppy OT period, the Browns would finally get the game-winner on another FG in an instant classic game that saw the Browns finally get out of the divisional round with clutch play (something you don't hear too often from Cleveland).
   * **AFC Championship (vs Broncos, 23-20 L, OT)**: unfortunately, the Broncos would return the favor to the Browns with their own game-tying drive, which ended in a TD (the play has since been immortalized as The Drive). The Browns would then blow their chance in OT and allow Denver to kick the game-winner in OT to miss a great shot at making the SB.
* **1987**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Colts, 38-21 W)**: in a tightly contested affair in the first 3 quarters, the Browns finally managed to pull away with a 17-point 4th quarter to pad the lead and take the game from Indianapolis, getting yet another chance at a Super Bowl Appearance.
   * **AFC Championship (@ Broncos, 38-33 L)**: unfortunately, it was not to be as the Browns suffered heartbreak at Denver's hands yet again. The Browns trailed 38-31 at one point but got to Denver's 2-yard line to set up a very makeable game-tying TD. But Cleveland fumbled the ball at that point (infamously known as The Fumble), and Denver easily won the game from there.
* **1988**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Oilers, 24-23 L)**: this game is heartbreaking for the Browns in hindsight as the NFL rulebook screwed them over. See, at this time, the NFL had no 2-point conversion option. Although the Browns would score a late TD to bring them to 24-22, the Browns could only kick the XP to make it 24-23, and the onside kick was recovered by Houston. Had this game been played a few years later, the result could've been very different.
* **1989**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Buffalo, 34-30 W)**: in a game that was somewhat of an offensive shootout, the Browns were one step ahead the entire way as Bernie Kosar had an impressive performance. The Bills had a shot to win the game but suffered a dropped pass in the end zone and then an interception deep in Browns territory to lose. The Browns got fortunate in that the Bills missed the XP on their last TD of the day which forced them to go for broke on their final drive. Otherwise, they could've easily just kicked a FG to tie the game.
   * **AFC Championship (@ Broncos, 37-21 L)**: in yet another rematch with the Broncos, the Browns were seeking revenge for their two previous championship game losses but instead crumbled late in the game again. They made it 24-21 at one point but allowed Denver to score 13 unanswered in the fourth quarter as the offense ran out of gas.
* **1994**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Patriots, 20-13 W)**: the Browns defense had a stellar game in intercepting three passes, although they got a scare late in the game as the Pats recovered an onside kick. But the Browns defense held, forcing a turnover on downs and winning the game.
   * **Divisional Round (@ Steelers, 29-9 L)**: unfortunately, the Browns offense went completely dead in the next game, and their defense didn't do much better, allowing 133 rushing yards from Barry Foster of Pittsburgh. At one point, Pittsburgh led 27-3, and this would be the last playoff win for the Browns franchise as a whole (unless you view this as the previous iteration of the Baltimore Ravens, which makes more sense but nope, that's not how the NFL wants you to see it).

**Detroit Lions (oh boy, get ready for a** ***lot*** **of losses...)**:

* **1970**:
   * **Divisional Round (@ Cowboys, 5-0 L)**: in one of the stranger NFL scores in the Super Bowl era, the Lions lost their first playoff game in the modern era that was just awful on so many levels. The only offensive score was in the first quarter: a Dallas FG. The Lions gave up another safety, then lost the game. How do you allow just 38 passing yards from the opposing team and still lose?
* **1982**:
   * **First Round (@ Redskins, 31-7 L)**: in a snoozefest of a game, the Lions went scoreless until the 3rd quarter and only when they were trailing 31-0 did they get their first TD. Eric Hipple had a good passing game but still threw 2 INTs. The Lions have at this point scored just 7 points in two playoff appearances.
* **1983**:
   * **Divisional Round (@ 49ers, 24-23 L)**: in a heartbreaking playoff loss, the Lions were the victim of another Joe Montana game-winning drive, then missed a very makeable 43-yard FG as time expired. At least they scored more than 7 points this time around? Also, did you know the Lions have not won in SF since 1975? OOF!
* **1991**:
   * **Divisional Round (vs Cowboys, 38-6 W)**: the Lions finally got to celebrate a home playoff game, and they made it memorable with an impressive performance on both sides, holding the Cowboys scoreless in the second half and absolutely wrecking the Dallas defense. They finally made the conference championship too. Let's hope this leads to more playoff wins! Oh wait...
   * **NFC Championship (@ Redskins, 41-10 L)**: the Lions would, unfortunately, put up a forgettable performance in their only conference championship game appearance to date, as Barry Sanders just had 44 yards and Washington held the Lions scoreless in the second half. Mark Rypien of Washington would add 2 TDs.
* **1993**:
   * **Wild Card (vs Packers, 28-24 L)**: in another heartbreaking playoff loss, the Lions were the victim of another game-winning drive by the opposing team, this one coming courtesy of Brett Favre. With 51 seconds and all three timeouts left, the Lions turned over the ball on downs to seal yet another early playoff exit.
* **1994**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Packers, 16-12 L)**: in a rematch against Green Bay the next season, the Lions offense went completely flat, with Barry Sanders held to -1 yards and the rushing attack to -4 yards. The Lions defense did all they could, but they ultimately lost another close game to their bitter rivals.
* **1995**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Eagles, 58-37 L)**: the Lions trailed 51-7 at one point and the majority of their points were scored in garbage time. Barry Sanders again went quiet in a playoff game, rushing for just 40 yards, and this loss was just awful for Detroit in so many ways.
* **1997**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Buccaneers, 20-10 L)**: after a 1-year hiatus, the Lions were held to just 75 passing yards and Barry Sanders again was stuffed, this time rushing for just 65 yards. Tampa Bay had a fairly uneventful offensive game but Detroit's offense choked in yet another playoff game.
* **1999:**
   * **Wild Card (@ Redskins, 27-13 L)**: the Lions offense again went flat, and they trailed 27-0 after the first half. Their only scoring would be done in the 4th quarter, with just 1 of those TDs being an offensive one (the other came on a blocked FG return). The Lions' playoff ineptitude took another turn for the worse.
* **2011**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Saints, 45-28 L)**: the Lions defense could not contain Drew Brees in this game, as he threw for 466 yards and 3 TDs. In a game where the Lions offense finally showed up, this time it was the other side of the ball that let them down.
* **2014**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Cowboys, 24-20 L)**: the Lions were such playoff chokers at this point, even Tony Romo got a playoff win at their expense. The Lions allowed Dallas to score 10 unanswered in the fourth quarter. True, Detroit was hurt by a bad call on a drive that could've potentially ended in a score, but in the end, they simply couldn't convert on one of their best opportunities to win a playoff game in years.
* **2016**:
   * **Wild Card (@ Seahawks, 26-6 L)**: at this point, the Wild Card is becoming a haunted house for the Lions. Detroit trailed just 10-6 after the 3rd quarter but allowed 16 straight points in the 4th to lose yet another game for Detroit. The Lions are now 0-11 in road playoff games.

On one hand, there's Joe Burrow who's had one of the best college football seasons ever seen and on the other you have an undefeated prospect that many are saying is comparable to Elway, Manning, etc and has never lost a college football game. Which one do you take? My gut tells me many would choose Lawrence but the swag that Burrow plays with is through the roof. I hope maybe we can get a clearer picture of Burrow tonight if he faces serious adversity with so much on the line but I also feel like we kind of got that glimpse with the Bama game and then the OU game. We know Lawrence has the ""it"" factor so to speak but we don't know yet how he's going to hold up physically in the NFL and the same can be said of Burrow I guess.

475,Every Rookie Head Coach to make it to a Conference Championship Game," With Matt Lafleur taking the Packers to the NFC Championship game in his first year as head coach I was wondering how many other coaches have done the same thing. Here is the list I came up with, if I missed anyone give me a heads up and I will add them:

1971 Don McCafferty Baltimore Colts (won Superbowl V over the Cowboys)

1977 Red Miller Broncos (lost Superbowl VII to the Cowboys)

1989 George Seifert 49ers (won Superbowl XXIV over the Broncos)

1997 Steve Mariucci 49ers (Lost NFC Championship to the Packers)

2002 Bill Callahan Raiders (Lost Superbowl XXXVII to the Buccaneers)

2006 Sean Payton Saints (Lost NFC Championship Game)

2009 Rex Ryan Jets (Lost AFC Championship Game)

2009 Jim Caldwell Colts (Lost Superbowl XLIV to the Saints)

2019 Matt Lafleur Packers

A couple of interesting notes:

* Gary Kubiak and Chuck Knox both led teams to Conference Championship Games in their first year as head coach of those teams, but both had previous NFL head coaching experience

* Only Don McCafferty and George Seifert went on to win the Superbowl, with Red Miller and Jim Caldwell the only others to advance to the big game

* Most of these coaches inherited very good football teams who were in the playoffs the year before they were hired. The exceptions are McCafferty, his Colts were in the Superbowl 2 years before he was hired but missed the playoffs in 1969, Ryan who was hired after the Jets went 9-7 and missed the playoffs in 2008, and Payton who took over a 3-13 Saints team in 2006.",nfl,backgrinder,15,2020-01-13

94,How well would Belichick have done from 2001-Present if Brady never existed?,"Belichick only had one winning season in 6 years as a head coach prior to 2001. Even prior to the 2000 season Belichick was not a hot commodity on the coaching market. Jonathan Kraft was on record saying that ""there wasn't one person who said to do it"" when asked how popular the Patriots decision of hiring Belichick was. Apparently Art Modell, owner of the Browns, told Robert Kraft too that it would be ""a huge mistake"" to hire Belichick. One doesn't need to think hard to speculate why. One winning season in 5 years as head coach does not exactly inspire confidence. Jay Gruden had a similar level in his first five seasons as head coach for the Redskins. It would be blasphemous to think that Gruden could ever become in time the greatest coach of all time. In 2001 the Patriots started 25th in the power rankings before falling to dead last after falling to 0-2 after two weeks. 

[http://web.archive.org/web/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/09/25/power\_rankings/](http://web.archive.org/web/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/09/25/power_rankings/)

Is it just a coincidence that Belichick turned his success around right at the same time as Brady became the starting quarterback?

Another thought to ponder on. The Belichick coaching tree is notorious for producing unsuccessful head coaches with other franchises except for Bill O'Brien (and you can make a case that BoB is actually holding them back). Why can't Belichick's model of success ever be replicated elsewhere? Could it perhaps be because none of the other coaches have Brady as their quarterback? 

This begs the question. How well would Belichick have done from 2001-Present if Brady never existed? It's not out of the realm that he'd be out of coaching all together. They were on their way to another disappointing season in 2001 before Bledsoe got hurt and Kraft may not have had the tolerance for back to back 5-11 seasons.",nfl,MisterBigChest84,25,2019-12-29

What would be some negatives if you could give a player an off year. Being on IR is not ""off"" it involves rehabilitation. I'm talking more of what if Luck could've stayed on contract but would be given a year to relax at a reduced salary. Sometimes long time players need a break more than they want to retire from the game. Perhaps only after a player has signed three contracts with a team could a ""off"" year happen.

135,The Seattle Seahawks are currently tied with the 1978 Houston Oilers for most games (10) in a season won by 8 or fewer points. They are the only 2 teams in history with 10 wins decided by a single possession.,"[Source](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=season&amp;year_min=1940&amp;year_max=2019&amp;game_type=R&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;temperature_gtlt=lt&amp;game_result=W&amp;c1stat=points_diff&amp;c1comp=lte&amp;c1val=8&amp;c5val=1.0&amp;order_by=pass_td)

Also fun fact, the Oilers went 10-6, and even 3 of their 6 losses were decided by one score. 

That year, the [Oilers](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/oti/1978.htm) made it to the conference championship game, beating the Dolphins 17-9 (another one-score game), blowing out the Patriots 31-14, and losing to the Steelers 5-34.",nfl,DrSwol,16,2019-12-29

138,What is the general read on Doug Pederson?,"If probabilities hold up, the Eagles will most likely win the NFC East today and lose on Wild Card weekend. I know anything can happen, but I'm going to go with this scenario as the probable result of the Eagles' 2019 season.

This would leave Doug's HC resume as follows...

2016...7-9...did not qualify  
2017...13-3...won Super Bowl  
2018...9-7...lost divisional round  
2019...9-7...lost Wild Card

Obviously 2017 speaks for itself, and will likely keep Doug employed thru the 2022 season barring complete catastrophe. But I'd like to point out that the Eagles went into both 2018 and 2019 with expectations of 11-12 wins and reasonable Super Bowl hopes. I wonder if it is time to question why this team has wound up on the edge of the playoff picture in two straight years that they were projected to be a premier team in the NFC.

There is no doubt that Doug and Carson will be firmly entrenched in their positions at the start of 2020, but will the front office decide that it is time to put Super Bowl LII in the rearview mirror and start applying pressure?",nfl,twenty42,52,2019-12-29

167,Were this year's Browns the biggest disappointment of all time? Even worse than the Dream Team Eagles?,"They threw a parade after a losing season last year and Browns players were constantly in the media tooting their own horns about ""CLEVELAND BEING BACK, BABY."" That cringeworthy Myles Garrett ""We're Here"" article comes to mind.

I don't want to hate on the Browns but boy does it feel so right after the season they had. Between Baker showing up chubby after doing a ton of commercials and then playing like a bottom 5 QB while constantly talking shit, to Freddie Kitchens fighting Colts players in training camp, to Myles Garrett nearly decapitating someone, to Kitchens' amateur hour t-shirt fiasco, to the safety threatening to fight fans through Twitter, to OBJ telling teams to come get him before games, to OBJ and Landry fighting Kitchens on the sidelines...just what a year it's been for them.",nfl,MoistGrannySixtyNine,11,2019-12-29
168,Live updating playoff picture (2019 week 17),"**2019 Week 17 Live Updating Playoff Picture**

And we're back for the final week of the season!  This is a live updating playoff picture. At the end of each game, this post will be updated with the remaining playoff scenarios (elimination and clinching).  Because there are so few scenarios this week, I am going to do seed updates as well.  Note that there is some redundancy in the seed scenarios for simplicity's sake (for example, it shows SF clinching a top 3 seed, a top 2 seed, and the 1 seed with a win - the 1 seed is a top 3 seed and a top 2 seed, so there is redundancy, but it's still comprehensive).  In these reduntant cases, just look for the highest seed that the scenarios matches.  I may change the wording as the games finish and change some scenarios.

Please note that I will be updating these manually this week, so please be patient as the games end.

If you have any questions about these scenarios or anything else tiebreaker/scenario-related, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to answer!

181,[OC] Punt Rank 2019: Week 16 - Your long overdue punt statistics update and the assassination of Michael Palardy by the cloud-of-smoke Nyheim Hines,"Welcome back, Punt Fans, to Week 16’s ~~absolutely on time~~ *insanely delayed by Christmas festivities and SO MUCH EATING AND MERRIMENT* edition of our weekly hunt for the King of Punt – it’s /r/NFL’s own Punt Rank. If you haven’t been here with me before, the concept is both simple and *fantastically* over-engineered. Lemme break it down:

* Each punter’s performance against **five vital punting metrics** is ranked against every other punter in the league.
* Those rankings are **combined into a weighted average ranking** – the 2019 NFL Punt Rank. 
* Punt Heroes rise to the top; Punt Zeros sink to the bottom.

This week on Punt Rank:

\- There were 159 (ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE!!) punts, by far the most of any game week this season; and

\- I still haven’t managed to watch them all because it’s been Christmas and I’ve had to, y’know, spend time with my family and stuff.

\- Michael Palardy died.

In a sneaky hour between turkey sandwiches and juuuuust before Week 17 gets underway I’ve managed to pull together the stats (despite ESPN removing some of the punters from their data, the scrooges!). Let’s see how the table looks…

# Michael Palardy – A Memorial

Friends and punt fans. We are gathered here to remember and pay our respects to **Michael Palardy (CAR),** dearly departed in Week 16 of the season. All he wanted for Christmas was to not have his entire year completely ravaged. And what did he get? Nyheim Hines coming down the chimney with a flamethrower, torching his tree, stamping all over his new remote control car and pissing in his 'nog. **Three punts, 195 return yards, TWO TOUCHDOWNS, Net Average Yards of -11.6** for the day (our first Negative NAY of the season y’all, rejoice!!). Palardy even threw a complete pass for 12 yards and a first down on a 4th and 10, and he still had the worst Christmas since Tiny Tim took a tumble and got a crutch where he wasn’t expecting it.

Palardy **falls 6 places to #39** (and last) in the rankings and will need the same kind of divine intervention as Tiny Tim if he’s going to get off the bottom of the table this week. We hope, of course we hope, but he’s very very sick.

# Where’s the rest of the commentary – Week 16 edition?

It’s Christmas, I had the week off. Bah Humbug! 

I will be back next week with a bumper update for our last Punt Rank of the season! Join me, brothers and sisters, to find out who your PUNT RANK CHAMPION 2019 is.

260,"The Bengals wish they were getting Trevor Lawrence, instead of Joe Burrow...(they should wait a year...to draft a QB)","I saw this entire season, the poll, ballots trying to count ""Clemson"" out of the College football playoff. If Alabama wouldn't have lost twice, no doubt in my mind, they'd have made it (If Tua, had not gotten 'hurt', in the sense of, just by him being there, the playoff committee would've had them there).

I like Joe Burrow, great guy, good kid, talented... But, he only played one season, on a stacked LSU team... He could be a decent QB in the right system, he may go #1 overall... But, Trevor Lawrence, if the rules permitted, would've been the top QB drafted last year! (as a freshman) if it was allowed, and this year, if in the draft, he'd be a better QB than Tua, Hurts, Burrow, the QB from Oregon, etc.... if he were 'permitted' to leave.

He's literally, the 2nd coming of Cam Newton. 6'6 can run like a gazelle, elusive, strong, and runs hard as heck... Burrow is good, can move a bit, but he's not Trevor Lawrence. For Burrow to be good, he needs a great system, top tier Linemen, and everything has to be 'put together' perfectly, which he won't get at the ""Bengals"" (Which will destroy his career if he's smart, him and his dad, will pull a Payton and Archie Manning, and refuse to get drafted by the Bengals(as they did with the Chargers) to go to a better team. This is what lead the Chargers to take ""Ryan Leaf"" and they (which is help, mind you) imploded(the team), and destroyed Ryan Leaf's career, etc...(He did it himself, but the Chargers, well, they added 'gasoline' to that fire, at the time the franchise was run abysmally)). At the Bengals, he'll end up like ""Josh Rosen"", put money on it. But, Lawrence, any team, 1-9, 2-8, etc... he'll alone get them 6-7 wins, he's that good. He's fast as heck, I imagine he runs at least a 4.6 flat, an arm like a cannon, and better decision making than a young Cam Newton... He's the next one up, bet on it. I'm iffy on Burrow since he's played just 'one season' though, he's ballin', the last LSU QB we all got into from 'one season'(reality one game, when he beat a 'overhyped' Notre Dame, with Brady Quinn at QB), was taken overall, was a dumpster fire, though a good dude(JaMarcus Russell). Just sayin'

 I'm not a Clemson fan, I'm a Pac-12 guy, and I used to play ball...

He's a 'once in a generation' QB, and Clemson has gone to so many National titles, 2 years in a row, and this could be their 3rd one(maybe), and Lawrence is a big part of that.

Prove me wrong, or concur with me... I know what I'm talking about.

(Also, I believe that if you were the National Champions the year before(as Clemson was) and you win out, a 12-0 Season, regardless of your schedule, you should get an 'auto bid' into the college playoff, despite ranking, etc... since if that's not the case, what is the point of winning the championship? Also, it should be an 8 bracket playoff 16 teams, and one bracket just for D2- D1AA, teams to give them a shot as well, am I right or what?)",nfl,Polojames123,0,2019-12-29

272,"Trevor Lawrence is the best QB, the 2- year rule(for college) should be repealed. He can play NFL right now...","I saw this entire season, the poll, ballots trying to count ""Clemson"" out of the College football playoff. If Alabama wouldn't have lost twice, no doubt in my mind, they'd have made it (If Tua, had not gotten 'hurt', in the sense of, just by him being there, the playoff committee would've had them there).

I like Joe Burrow, great guy, good kid, talented... But, he only played one season, on a stacked LSU team... He could be a decent QB in the right system, he may go #1 overall... But, Trevor Lawrence, if the rules permitted, would've been the top QB drafted last year! (as a freshman) if it was allowed, and this year, if in the draft, he'd be a better QB than Tua, Hurts, Burrow, the QB from Oregon, etc.... if he were 'permitted' to leave.

He's literally, the 2nd coming of Cam Newton. 6'6 can run like a gazelle, elusive, strong, and runs hard as heck... Burrow is good, can move a bit, but he's not Trevor Lawrence. For Burrow to be good, he needs a great system, top tier Linemen, and everything has to be 'put together' perfectly, which he won't get at the ""Bengals"" (Which will destroy his career if he's smart, him and his dad, will pull a Payton and Archie Manning, and refuse to get drafted by the Bengals(as they did with the Chargers) to go to a better team. This is what lead the Chargers to take ""Ryan Leaf"" and they (which is help, mind you) imploded(the team), and destroyed Ryan Leaf's career, etc...(He did it himself, but the Chargers, well, they added 'gasoline' to that fire, at the time the franchise was run abysmally)). At the Bengals, he'll end up like ""Josh Rosen"", put money on it. But, Lawrence, any team, 1-9, 2-8, etc... he'll alone get them 6-7 wins, he's that good.

Brady is obviously getting older and while some throws have definitely been misses on his part, it's easy to see he's not comfortable with new guys like Harry, Meyers, and Sanu.

Not worried about him at the game because of said suite, he is a ham for other people, and we have noise protection for him. 

I have called most the numbers on the Redskins website and they are out for regular business hours. I went on the Redskins website and from what I can tell from the stadium guide is:

- no diaper bag, only a clear bag in regulation with the all clear nfl policies
- no strollers but silent on baby carriers 
- bottles are mentioned on the prohibited items (but listed with jugs, thermos, etc) 
- there’s an exception for brining in medically necessary supplies at a separate entrance, but it doesn’t list qualifying items or the entrance to use
- as a child under 2 he does not need a ticket since he is eligible for a lap ticket that is issued at each entrance upon entering the game 

Appreciate all replies, even those telling me I am an irresponsible dumbass for trying this. Go Birds!

64,unpopular opinion : Lamar Jackson is not an elite throwing QB,"the media is making it sound like Lamar learned how to be an elite throwing QB after being mediocre at the pass game in his first year when infact that is not the case. why? first let me start with this example


Lets look at RG3 rookie season,  815 rushing yards, impressive. 20/5  TD/Int 102.4 passer rating

his second season (and patter on onward) when his knees and running game was weakened: 16/12 TD/Int,  489 Yards rushing. 

the point am trying to make is that Lamar running ability is allowing him to have the easiest opprtunity to throw uncontested wide open passes often. and hes not even being pressured inside due to the fact that its a risk to blitz him. so the Dline stacks box and sits there often. leaving him to throw the ball to one or two wide open receivers.",nfl,GegaMan,5,2019-12-14

68,Jared Goff or Lamar Jackson?,"This is a serious topic.

Would you rather have Jared Goff or Lamar Jackson?  Do not think about just this year as Lamar is the MVP and the most dominating QB this season, even more so than Mahomes.  However minus the hype, teams will figure out him next year and Lamar will be force to throw in the pocket which his accuracy plummets sigificantly.  Against elite teams, Lamar could not reach even 200 yards passing and he only has one 300 yards passing game this entire season.

He can throw because of his threat as a runner which open up receiving lanes.  But he can't win without using his legs as we seen over and over again.  He has lot of TD's but low passing yardages.  Goff on the other hand is a true accurate pocket quarterback that will only get better.  Goff has 5 more years before he reach his prime, and is already ahead of Brady, Brees back when they were his age.  Goff and McVay will be the next Peyton and Brees meaning they will be together for a long time and will continue to get better every year.  Meanwhile Lamar Jackson is one hit away from having to rely on his arms instead of his legs.",nfl,ChaseYounghoe,24,2019-12-14

102,How weather affects football games,"In light of the expected snow game in Kansas city, I was curious how that affects performance. Everyone acknowledges its affect, but I have never seen much data to back it up.

I was only able to find 3 sources of statistical analysis. They all seem to agree that wind has the greatest impact, and us pretty significant, and temperature has slightly less of an impact. Ironically, they all claimed to not have enough data to draw conclusions about snow. 

[WeatherWorks](https://weatherworksinc.com/news/weather-and-football)

&gt;For the most part, wind affects all teams equally by decreasing passing efficiency by approximately 0.5 yards per attempt at 15 - 20 mph or greater. On the other hand, there are some eye-popping statistics about how temperature affects teams. In particular, dome teams suffer the most, which can be seen in the chart above. Dome teams win less than 20% of games played at cold weather stadiums when the temperature is 30 degrees or below. From 2000-2011, this scenario occurred 23 times, with the dome team winning just 3 games! Warm climate teams don't fair much better, winning approximately 35% of the time playing at cold weather stadiums (when it is cold). For reference, the league average winning percentage for away teams is 42.7%. Looking at the league as a whole, it appears colder weather effects completion percentage and the amount of drops. The league averages 61% passing completion to start the season in September, but only 59.2% in December and just 56.4% in January. Drops per game become increasingly higher by the winter, rising 0.5 - 1 per game.

[Towards Data Science ](https://towardsdatascience.com/football-weather-diving-into-the-effects-of-weather-on-nfl-qb-performance-f0edb420623d)

&gt;The effect of wind/wind gusts is the most significant weather variable affecting QB performance. The effects are fairly slight for avg wind speeds from 0 mph up to about 15 mph, but above that threshold, the difference in fantasy points is about 12% less. In games with winds over 20 mph, the negative effects are more significant, with ~17% fewer fantasy points per game.

&gt;Precipitation, on its own, is basically inconclusive. Although the average fantasy points are lowest for games with light rain, the data for games with rain/storm and snow are not statistically significant.

&gt;Temperature, as an isolated weather variable, doesn’t have much of an affect on QB performance.

&gt;QBs across the board tend to score 8–10% more fantasy points in great weather than in bad weather. A small handpicked sample of QBs who play their home games in a dome or great weather cities, on a relative percentage basis, didn’t perform much worse in bad weather than QBs who tend to play in bad weather more frequently.

[Advanced Football Analytics ](https://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/index.php/home/research/weather/163-weather-effects-on-passing)

&gt;The big takeaway should be that temperature does in fact hurt the passing game. Does it hurt dome and warm climate teams more than others? The chart below tells the tale. It's noisier than we'd like, but one thing we can tell is that the colder the weather the lower the passing efficiency for all types of team climates.",nfl,lightning_fire,16,2019-12-14

The Broncos and the Chiefs will battle it out

Same with the Phins and the G men, two teams where futures are in doubt

The Titans vs the Texans in the battle of the T's

And the Eagles vs D.C. I think they will win with ease

The Browns and the Cards with the two Heisman winners

The Jags and the Raiders, who next year will be cheered on by some sinners

The Bolts and the Vikes, I do sure miss Randy Moss

The Rams are in Dallas who some say Jerry should step down as boss

The 49ers tried to defend home against the Dirty Birds and Marty Ice

The Bills visit the Steelers, a game I predict will be nice

The Ravens already doubled up on the hapless Jets

*indicates that they’ve already clinched a winning season

Rams* - 4  
Bills* - 4  
Lions+ - 4  
Raiders - 3  
Browns - 1  

Some surprising takeaways from this:  

•3 teams with 5 or fewer seasons have already clinched a winning season this year. Only 2 of them have clinched a losing season.   

•The Chargers are tied for 4th here, which comes as a surprise, given that they’ve been a top team maybe one time in the last season. I think it’s easy to forget their general success (or lack of obvious failure) because of they have been mostly 8-8 or 9-7 since 2010 apart from a couple fairly bad seasons before their recent success. 

•8 of the top 10 teams have won a Super Bowl in this span, the only ones who haven’t are the Cowboys and the Chargers, who both haven’t appeared in a Super Bowl in the 2000s.  

•The Rams and 49ers both have appeared in a super Bowl despite having winning seasons in only 1/3 or less of this span. This means that the bottom 10 has as many teams that made a Super Bowl as top 10 teams that have not. 

•Extending this range to the entire millennium, 2 more bottom 10 teams have made a Super Bowl, those having played against each other (Raiders &amp; Buccaneers). 

•The Bills are the lowest team to clinch a winning season; the Falcons are the highest team to clinch a losing season.  

•The Ravens, tied for 4th, are the highest team to have started more than 3 QBs for non-injury/suspension reasons in that span. 

•The Steelers, surprisingly, join the Patriots in being the only teams having had no losing seasons in the last 15 years. This is a surprise given that they’re generally viewed as somewhat successful but distinctly below the Patriots.",nfl,theaiwei,12,2019-12-15

316,Schooling The Draft: Alabama (1930s),"Welcome to the next edition of my “Schooling the Draft” series, where we will take a look at Alabama! Now since the Crimson Tide decided to be a major SEC player that will never disappear, they have sent A LOT of players to the NFL, so I will be breaking them down by decade. So here we go!

**By Teams**

* Boston/Washington Redskins 2

* Brooklyn Dodgers 3

* Cleveland Rams 1

* Detroit 1

* New York Giants 1

**By Position**

* Quarterback 1

* Halfback 2

* Guard 3

* Center 1

* End 1

**By Round**

* 1st round 1

* 2nd round 2

* 3rd round 1

* 4th round 1

* 5th round 1

* 7th + rounds 2

**Players**

**Kavanaugh Francis**

* Center who was drafted in the 5th round of the 1936 Draft by the Detroit Lions. 

* Offered $50 a game to play, but declined and opted to work at an auto plant

**Paul “Bear” Bryant**

* End who was drafted in the 4th round of the 1936 draft by Brooklyn, but would never play a down. 

* Would instead go back to college for coaching, where he head head coaching jobs at Maryland (45), Kentucky (46-53), Texas A&amp;M (54-57), and most famously Alabama (58-82).

**Riley Smith**

* Quarterback who was drafted by the Boston Redskins with the 2nd overall pick in the 1936 draft, playing 3 seasons with the team. He appeared in 30 games, starting 27 of them

* In his 3 seasons, he completed 19 passes of 46 attempts for 290 yards, 3 TDs, and 3 interceptions 

* Rushed the ball 45 times for 58 yards and 2 TDs. 

* Had 18 receptions for 300 yards and 3 TDs

* Kicked 11 field goals, with the longest being 38 yards 

* 1937 NFL Champion 

* Retired after suffering an injury, prior to that he played all but 3 minutes during his time with the Redskins. 

* Appeared on numerous 2nd team All-Pro teams each year of his career.

**Tarzan White**

* 2nd round guard drafted by the New York Giants 

* appeared in 32 games and 7 starts with the Giants across 4 seasons (37-39, 45) and 18 games with 12 starts with the Chicago Cardinals (40-41)

* 1938 Pro Bowler

**Leroy Monskey**

* Guard who was drafted by Brooklyn in the 7th round of the 1938 Draft.

**Joe Kilgrow**

* Halfback that was drafted in the 2nd round of the 1938 Draft by the Brooklyn dodgers 

* Declined to play and instead chose to go back to his alma mater as a running backs coach.

**Lew Bostick**

* Guard who was drafted in the 9th round of the 1939 Draft by the Cleveland Rams

* Appeared in 7 games with 2 starts in 1939 and 1 more game in 1942.

**Charley Holm**

* Drafted by the Washington Redskins in the 3rd round of the 1939 NFL Draft

This includes Alabama’s contributions in the 1930s of the NFL Draft. 7 people were drafted, including the second person ever drafted. We have also seen the Dodgers draft 3 of the 7 players taken in the 30s, with guard being the most popular opinion. For a look at previous entries, please check out the [hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/cdj1at/the_requested_hub_post/). Next we will take a look at Alabama in the 1940s!",nfl,bigkodack,4,2019-12-15

332,Live updating playoff picture (2019 week 15),"**Week 15 Live Updating Playoff Picture**

And we're back for another great week of playoff scenarios!  This is a live updating playoff picture. At the end of each game, this post will be updated with the remaining playoff scenarios (elimination and clinching).

I am attempting to do some partial automation of these posts this year.  Please let me know if you see anything in error after games have been processed.  However, not everything is automated yet, so please bear with me as I try to handle all the games ending close to each other.

To go ahead and stem questions about the OAK scenarios: **Yes, there are NFC teams in the OAK scenarios.  These are for TEN clinching at least a tie in Strength of Victory over OAK.  A win or tie by ATL, NE, or CLE or a loss or tie by CHI, DET, DEN, or LAC will clinch this for TEN for the OAK tie + TEN tie + IND loss scenarios.**

If you have any questions about these scenarios or anything else tiebreaker/scenario-related, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to answer!  Enjoy!

I think that in light of the new evidence made public we seriously call in to question the sophistication of this operation.

You don't record the Bengals of all people on just a one-off, this suggests if you're going to do it against the worst teams at the time, what are you doing to get ahead of the best?

Furthermore, the man videotaping clearly sounds like he has one objective: to destroy the footage as fast as possible and before more damage could be done. He knew exactly what he was doing.

I just personally feel as if this is a horrible plan that I can’t see Belichick going with. I’m really hoping this is just a videographer who made a mistake and got blasted because of it.

395,Should the Patriots’ Super Bowl wins have an asterisk?,"With all the controversy surrounding them lately, especially with Spygate 2.0 and video surfacing of the supposed “field footage” was completely looking at the Bengals sideline the entire time, it makes me think that the Patriots legacy is tarnished by they’re constant blatant cheating, yet no one talks about it. 

Personally, it kind of puts a taint on Belli and Brady’s greatness together, since they always seem to bend or break the rules and get caught doing it, yet Brady is seen as the greatest QB of all time. Would he have won 6 Super Bowls without cheating? Who knows, but what I do know is that these situations, are definitely cheating, anyone who says they aren’t is either a Patriots fan who doesn’t care as long as they win, or an idiot. I think Tom Brady is a great QB, one of the best, and has a great story behind his draft selection and leading a team to relevancy. It’s possible this is all Kraft or Bellicheck and Brady has no idea. Although Brady would’ve definitely known about Deflategate, so we can’t excuse him from cheating with ignorance. You know the saying; once a cheater, always a cheater.

And these are the things we’ve caught them for, and we even caught and penalized them for the first Spygate, and now with all the credentials and permissions to be there, they try the same thing again when they know people don’t trust them not to cheat? The balls on this organization, but it shows how little the average NFL fan cares about this stuff. The same people who cheered on Barry Bonds every time he knocked a ball into the next city, they don’t care who cheats as long as they get to scream like a moron and celebrate. I’m ashamed of it and honestly, sports in general is turning this way, with the Patriots being the great team in NFL History*, the NBA refs calling games to allow one team to win or cover a spread so they can win money off of gambling, steroid use in the MLB and UFC, even the NHL with its old boys club of assaulting players and basically daring them to do something. Don’t even get me started with FIFA and the Olympics.

My solution? The Patriots should re-play every Super Bowl game they’ve done, against the team they originally played against, with all the same roster of people, retired or not. This will be huge for Brady, who seems ageless, but with Gronk losing 50lbs of muscle this year, it could be interesting. That’s a game I’d watch.",nfl,BiggaTheCondomFilla,2,2019-12-15

411,"[OC] Why the ""independent contractor"" defense won't fly for the Patriots","I've been seeing a lot of Patriots fans using the independent contractor who filmed the sideline as a fall guy for videotaping signals. This is essentially a moot point because simply labeling a worker as an independent contractor does not get rid of liability. 

The IRS has been fighting people who cheat on taxes with independent contractor/employee labels for years and developed a 20 factor test on what really settles an employer-employee relationship. 

The videographer is an employee of the Patriots and they're going to get hit hard, especially with the video being released today. Unbelievable.

-The guy worked for Kraft media, which is under the same umbrella as the Patriots.

-The team suspended the videographer today, ipso facto settling that this is a team employee. Normally you dont have the power to suspend an independent contractor like you do with an employee.

-The guy has been working with the Patriots for weeks. 

-The Patriots furnished media equipment to the videographer.

-The Patriots paid for the videographers travel expenses to the Browns stadium. 

Thereby we can conclude the Patriots are liable for negligent hiring and negligent supervision within the NFL rules. It's baffling that a team which has been accused of doing the same exact thing over a decade ago and had a database of signals personally destroyed by Goodell would partake in the same exact behavior.",nfl,MoistGrannySixtyNine,4,2019-12-15

**The Swag**

This is the first time I've ever seen a Bills team with well earned swagger. This team is on fire, and is playing fearless in all aspects of the game. After the game today, I don't think I've ever seen a Buffalo team have as much fucking badassery involved in it as this one does.

*Josh Allen*

Josh motherfucking Allen had the game of his life. In his first primetime game ever, he kept his cool and systematically shredded the Cowboys defense through the air and to through the ground. Fuck me give this man a franchise extension already because whatever he has, this is it.

*Defense*

Hot damn this defense is special. They came together and regained their team effort and mojo right as the offense got hot and holy hell is this unit great.

**The Good**

*Brian Daboll*

I'm going to eat my own words from the Browns game. Keep Daboll. Once he moved to the box he has shown that he is able to actually use our teams roster to move the ball down field at a good pace, keeping the pieces moving and holy shit that trick play was something out of Andy Reid's playbook.

132,**Predicting the NFL 100 All-Time Quarterbacks,"With the NFL All-Time team beginning this week with Running Backs, Linebackers and Defensive Linemen, I thought I'd take an early shot at predicting the 10 QBs that will make the roster (announced in late December). Let’s start with an important disclaimer: this list will not necessarily be simply the top 10 QBs of alltime. As seen from the 12 Running Backs chosen, the selection committee has placed an emphasis on picking players **across all eras**. (For the record, I thought Ladanian Tomlinson and Marshall Faulk were very unlucky to be omitted). Narrowing down the list of so many great Quarterbacks across history is insanely difficult and there will have to be some ridiculously unfair omissions from the final 10. This post turned out to be very long, as I provided a brief outline of each potential candidate, so if you just want the final predictions, scroll all the way down to the bottom. For those interested, I hope this provides some insight into the history of the best Quarterbacks to have played in the NFL, and as to how hard the final selection will be. 

#THE LOCKS

There are 5 Quarterbacks who I believe will be 100% locks to make this team: **OTTO GRAHAM**, **JOHNNY UNITAS**, **JOE MONTANA**, **PEYTON MANNING** and **TOM BRADY**. These five players were considered the defining players of their era, with enduring legacies upon the game. All 5 won multiple championships, MVPs and other accolades and broke a significant amount of records in their time. These players have incredible win percentages and were consistently able to elevate their teams to be among the best in the league year in, year out. Graham, Unitas and Montana were all named in the 1st Team for their respective decade, and made the 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994. Manning made the 2nd Team All-Decade for the 2000s, but won a record 5 MVPs. Brady is going to be the 1ST Team All-Decade QB for both the 2000s and the 2010s. 

#THE REMAINING CANDIDATES

With 5 spots locked down, there is an incredible competition to make the final 5 spots on this team. I’ve approached this by narrowing down the candidates into the best few from each era: Pre-Super Bowl Era, Early-Super Bowl Era, 1980s-1990s, and the Modern Era. It’s important to note that when the 75th Anniversary Team was announced in 1994, only 4 QBs were included- (Baugh, Graham, Unitas and Montana). Therefore, it’s reasonable to expect a higher amount of players from the 1980s onwards will be added to the original list this time around.

#PRE-SUPER BOWL ERA

**ARNIER HERBER**: 1930s All-Decade Team, 4x NFL Champion, 3x 1st Team All-Pro. Regarded as the first great long thrower in NFL history, holding the all-time passing yards record for 11 years, and the TDs mark for 3 years. Formed an iconic combo with fellow Packers legend Don Hutson. Unfortunately was left off both the 50th and 75th Anniversary Team, making his selection to the 100th All-Time Team a longshot. 

**SAMMY BAUGH**: 1940s All-Decade Team, 2x NFL Champion, 7x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x NFL Player of the Year. One of the greatest 2-way players of all time, and set NFL records in 3 positions: QB, Punter and DB. Led the league in passing on 4 occasions, held the all-time passing yards record for 16 years and the touchdowns mark for 19 seasons. Made the 75th Anniversary All-Time team which makes him nearly a 100% lock to make the NFL 100 All-Time Team. 

**SID LUCKMAN**: 1940s All-Decade Team, 4x NFL Champion, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x MVP. The first great T-Formation QB. Still holds the NFL record for career TD% and remains one of the greatest downfield passers of all time. Statistically overshadowed by the other great QB of the 1940s Baugh, but led the Bears to more championships. Remarkably still has a share of the record for most TD passes in a game (7). However he didn’t make the 75th Anniversary Team and remains an outsider for the NFL 100 All-Time team, partly due to the likelihood of Sammy Baugh making the cut, and the rapid expansion of the passing game favouring more recent QBs.  

Honourable mention: **BOBBY LAYNE**: 1950s All-Decade Team, 3x NFL Champion, 3x 1st Team All-Pro. Unfortunately I don’t see him making the final cut, due to the presence of Otto Graham in the same era, and the emergence of Johnny Unitas. 

#EARLY SUPER-BOWL ERA

**BART STARR**: 1960s All-Decade Team, 5x NFL Champion, 1x NFL MVP, 1x 1st Team All-Pro. The MVP of the first two Super Bowls, Bart Starr is remembered as one of the all-time great winners and arguably the most efficient passer of all time (adjusted for era). Whilst his volume stats were not in the same league as the likes of Johnny Unitas, Starr led the league in passer rating on 5 occasions, and to this day still holds the record for career post-season passer rating with a ludicrous 104.8! A career post-season record of 9-1 cements Starr as one of the greatest post-season players of all-time, and the infamous QB sneak in the Ice-Bowl remains one of the iconic plays in NFL History. However, the Packers were not a team that heavily relied on the QB position, compared to the likes of the Baltimore Colts with Unitas. Starr’s individual accolades might hold him back from a spot in the 100th Anniversary Team. 

**TERRY BRADSHAW**: 1970s All-Decade 1st Team, 4x Super Bowl Champion, 1x MVP, 1X 1ST Team All-Pro. Bradshaw is a player who I believe gets an unfair rap here on this sub, with a popular opinion being that Bradshaw was an average QB with mediocre stats who was carried by a historic defense and head coach. Whilst these arguments have merit, Bradshaw was really an earlier version of Brett Favre: a fuck it, chuck it gunslinger with one of the most powerful arms in NFL history, and a player whose impact can’t be measured by raw stats. Looking at his career, the first 4 and a bit years were poor, as Bradshaw took his time to adjust to the NFL. However, after retaking the starting role midway through the 74 season, Bradshaw became the leader of the most successful franchise of the 1970s, noted for his remarkable play in the postseason. Bradshaw finished with a 4-0 record in Super Bowls, twice winning the MVP, and never finished with a Passer Rating below 108 (throwing 9 TDs to 4 interceptions). So remarkable was his play in the postseason, he was chosen over Staubach to make the 1st Team All-Decade team of the 1970s. Bradshaw’s name recognition might make up for his lack of individual accolades and weaker argument for being an all-time great, and so he remains a reasonable chance of being included on the NFL 100 All-Time Team. 

**ROGER STAUBACH**: 1970s All-Decade 2nd Team, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 1x Super Bowl MVP. Before the time of Joe Montana and Tom Brady, Roger the Dodger was the original Captain America and the comeback king. Despite only starting his NFL career aged 29, Staubach led the Cowboys to 4 Super Bowl appearances, winning twice. Staubach remains one of the most efficient passers of all-time, with a career Passer Rating of 83.4 (2nd highest ever at the time). Regarded as one of the best scramblers of all-time, and one of the greatest clutch players in NFL history, Staubach was the creator of the “Hail Mary” pass, coining the term to describe his 50 yard bomb vs the Vikings in the 1975 playoffs to win the game. However, Staubach’s case is hurt by the lack of individual accolades (no MVPs or 1st Team All-Pros), due to not being a high-volume passer who rarely led the league in yards or TDs. This is one of the toughest decisions the selection committee will face: Is legacy and championship performances worth more than individual accolades and accomplishments? 

Honourable mention: **FRAN TARKENTON**- 1x MVP, 1x 1st Team All-Pro. Was the all-time Passing Yards leader for 19 seasons, and held the career TDs mark for 20 years. 

#1980s-1990s

**JOHN ELWAY**: 1990s All-Decade 1st Team, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 1x MVP, 1x 1ST Team All-Pro, 9x Pro Bowls. Another player whose impact and legacy goes way beyond individual statistics and efficiency ratings. John Elway when he retired was regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time, and a QB who was equally bit as gifted physically as he was clutch. At the time of his retirement, he was the all-time leader in career wins and game-winning drives, held the record for most conference championships with 5, finishing 2nd all-time in career yards and 3rd in TDs.  The early half of his career dragged his career numbers down playing with little talent around him and in an archaic offensive system, but he managed to drag the Broncos to the big game 3 times. The end of his career surrounded with better talent and coaching saw him achieve the fairy-tale finish of back to back Super Bowl wins and a spot on the 1st Team All-Decade Team of the 1990s. Iconic moments such as “The Drive” vs the Browns in 1986 cement his legacy as one of the greatest winners in NFL history, and he will be a likely inclusion on the NFL 100th All-Time Team. 

**DAN MARINO**: 1x MVP, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 9x Pro-Bowler. Arguably the greatest pure passer to ever play the game, Marino shattered numerous records over a 17 year career with the Dolphins. Blessed with the quickest release of all-time and a powerful arm, Marino’s first 6 seasons took the NFL by storm. His 1984 campaign is still probably the greatest ever season by a QB, as he became the first ever 5000 yard passer while shattering the TD record with 48. Marino flew past Tarkenton’s career records, holding the career passing yards and touchdowns title for 12 years, remarkably still holding a place in the top 5 all-time to this day. However, Marino never really reached the insane levels of his early career again, and despite finishing 2nd all-time in regular season wins, his resume is highlighted by a lack of post-season success. Being regarded as perhaps the most talented passer ever who set the bar higher than any of his peers should be enough to secure a spot on the All-Time Team, but it’s far from a guarantee with some of the other players in contention who have more complete career resumes.  

**STEVE YOUNG**: 1x Super Bowl Champion (as a starter), 2x MVP, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 7x Pro Bowler. Steve Young took over from the legendary Montana as the starter and proceeded to have maybe the most dominant 8 year peak in NFL history. In this time, he led the league in TDs on 4 occasions, while being the highest rated passer 6 times. His career Passer Rating as a 49er is a mind-boggling 101.4, all while racking up over 4000 yards and 40 TDs on the ground, thus retiring as the greatest duel-threat QB ever. Whilst his career peak is ridiculous, the argument against Young’s inclusion on the final roster comes down to a lack of longevity and the fact that he played in the revolutionary West-Coast Offense that was years ahead of its time (the less said about his time with the Buccaneers, the better). Despite his regular season dominance, Young never matched Montana’s post-season exploits, winning “just the one Super Bowl” and whose career was often defined by falling short in the post-season, often at the hands of the Cowboys. Much like Dan Marino, Steve Young’s peak is as good as any in NFL history, but his chances of making the NFL 100 All-Time team are worsened by several other QBs with greater longevity and thus more complete career resumes. 

Honourable Mention: **TROY AIKMAN**- 3x Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler: Deserves a mention for his incredible postseason success, but won’t have a chance to make the final roster due to a lack of individual achievements. Mostly played second fiddle to Emmitt Smith, which definitely impacted his career stats.

#MODERN-ERA

**BRETT FAVRE**- 1990s All-Decade 2nd Team, 1x Super Bowl Champion, 3x MVP, 3x 1ST Team All-Pro. The greatest gunslinger in NFL history, capable of the most jaw-dropping plays and the most bone-headed mistakes. Winning 3 straight MVPs shows just how good Favre was at his peak, resulting in 2 Super Bowl appearances in this timeframe. He retired as the all-time leader in both career passing yards and TDs, and yet his two most impressive records are the 297 game iron-man streak, and the mammoth 336 interceptions he threw (neither mark will be challenged any time soon). Although he remains an all-time great, his inclusion in the NFL 100 All-Time Team depends on how many modern players the committee goes for, where Favre sits behind 2 absolute locks in Brady and Manning. 

**DREW BREES**- 1x Super Bowl Champion, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 12x Pro Bowler. The New Orleans legend’s case for inclusion on the All-Time roster is pretty straightforward: he’s the NFL’s passing king, already owning the career yards record and will very likely finish up as the all-time leader in TD passes. Add in the fact that Brees has simply demolished every completion % record possible, and owns five 5000 yard seasons out of 11 total and you have an almost iron-clad case for making one of the 10 spots. The only flaws in an impressive career are the lack of MVPs and 1st Team All-Pros, which basically can be explained by Brees being the victim of circumstances-playing in the same era as 3 or 4 other QBs who likely go down as top 10 of all-time, and playing on some all-time bad defences. Overall, it’s a hard ask to leave the all-time passing leader off the final list, and thus Brees is a likely candidate to make the NFL 100 All-Time Team. 

**AARON RODGERS**- 1x Super Bowl Champion, 2x MVP, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 7x Pro Bowler. Rodgers will likely finish his career as the greatest statistical QB of all time, currently having the highest ever career Passer Rating and a nonsensical TD:Int ratio better than 4:1. Widely acclaimed as the most talented QB to play the game, Rodgers peak from 2011-14 remains as high as any ever seen in NFL history, and a Super Bowl win in 2010 is the icing on an already impressive career resume. Rodgers is almost certain to finish his career as one of the 10 greatest QBs to play the game, but might be a victim of bad timing here: he’s still got years left in his career that will not be a part of the first 100 years of the NFL, and other modern QBs like Brady, Manning, Brees and Favre are also up for selection with more complete careers. 

#FINAL PREDICTIONS

Having overviewed the list of potential QBs, my final prediction for the NFL 100 All-Time team is as follows: **Brady**, **Manning**, **Montana**, **Unitas** and **Graham** are 100% locks to make the roster, taking up the first 5 spots. **Sammy Baugh** gets in as the outstanding QB of the 1930s and 1940s. **Terry Bradshaw** is the controversial selection on the team due his historical significance and being the standout player from the 1970s, even though he is not considered a top 10 all-time QB. **John Elway** and **Dan Marino** edge out Steve Young for spots on the 100 Year Team, owing their selection to the incredible legacies they built in their playing days. Finally, with the hardest choice so far, **Drew Brees** legacy as the all-time passing leader is enough to edge out a pair of Green Bay legends in Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. Ideally, I’d choose either one of Favre or Rodgers over Bradshaw, but with the emphasis on picking players from all generations, I can’t see Brady, Manning and two of Brees, Rodgers and Favre being selected from the modern era.",nfl,SMEN1996,37,2019-11-29

Can someone please explain to me how this makes even a modicum of sense? I understand they needed a field goal and a touchdown but why squander a first down on a field goal when you could at least take a shot or two at the endzone? Or just continue the drive in hope of a TD and save the field goal for your last drive? I see absolutely 0 benefit to kicking the fg on first down on that drive, perhaps I'm overlooking some consideration?",nfl,furbz420,57,2019-11-29

Thanks!",nfl,PCodeXbro,12,2019-11-29
284,My updated power rankings after thanksgiving:,"1. Baltimore - Looking like the most complete team and one of the more unique offenses we’ve ever seen. There is still a slight worry in my mind that coaches facing them a second time can “figure him out” but Lamar has proven he can throw it over the top, which is not something he offered last year. B-More also can pound the football and keep their already pretty sound defense fresh. Hopefully Judon is okay.

2. San Francisco - People oozing over the defensive front makes sense but I think the offense is gonna be what puts them over the top if they want to make a run. Jimmy has proven to be a solid QB and their zone running will travel with them in the postseason if they even end up needing to go on the road. I have always said Shanny is a better offensive mind than McVay and I think his scheme is more sustainable, even though I’m sure that sounds obvious at this point. My only worries with this team are a) Jimmy is unproven in pressure situations and b) you can run on this team.

3. New Orleans - I would argue this is the deepest and most talented roster in the league. Skill players, pass rush, defensive secondary, special teams, and of course QB. It’s gonna be hard to find more than 2-3 teams who are better than NOLA at any of these areas in the league. My only worry is if Brees and the team can finish, as they’ve been prone to peaking early in the season in recent years. When Drew got hurt I actually said it would end up being a blessing in disguise for this team, as it would potentially help keep Drew fresh. If they get the 1 seed I think it will be hard to bet against them.

4. New England - I still think New England has the best defense in the league if you factor in coaching. It’s hard to run on New England and I think they pretty clearly have the best secondary in the league. Offensively they look a little stale but in a weak AFC I think they have a great shot to get to the super bowl if they secure the 1 seed. A rematch against Bmore would be interesting. There are definitely some questions here but I still think they are good enough to win a title, especially with the less competitive AFC being all that’s in their way of getting to a SB.

5. Seattle - It’s been a weird year for us considering it doesn’t feel like we should be a top 5 team but here we are. Despite RW’s great season, the most encouraging thing for us right now is our defense is finally stepping up after what was the worst first half of a season defensively for us *ever* under Carroll. Obviously we would like to get home field but it’s also encouraging to be undefeated on the road this year. I don’t really know what else to say about us. We’re not particularly scary anywhere except QB but I do believe we can beat anyone. Let me also just throw in my one homer comment and say the Quandre Diggs trade is gonna end up being an all time fleecing. It’s amazing what a good single high safety can do for a Pete Carroll defense (RIP EARL).

6. Buffalo - The defense is for real. Allen isn’t exactly polished yet but he can make big plays and seems to keep improving. Combine it with their coaching and their style, which I think travels well, and they will be a tough out and I really think they could steal a game in Kansas City or Houston.

7. Minnesota - Maybe the best roster in the NFC besides NOLA. Kirk looks to be figuring things out. What makes them scarier this year is that they can beat you on the ground or in the air. Good playmakers on D. I think the NFC and their seed is gonna be too much for them to make a run this year but they are gonna be tough to handle no matter what. The game on Monday vs. Seattle is huge. The 5 seed in the NFC could be big considering it could be the difference from having to play Dallas or Green Bay in Lambeau, the latter not being ideal.

8. Kansas City - This team has a lot of issues (some are injuries) but they are still scary and the ending stretch of this season is gonna be big to get themselves in a groove. I think they matchup poorly against a lot of teams for obvious reasons, but they are still capable of getting to a SB if they can outscore NE and/or Baltimore, both of which are entirely possible.

9. Green Bay - Packers are a good team but I simply am not scared of Rodgers like I used to be. I think the ceiling is lower for GB in comparison to the other NFC playoff teams. The defense is good, not *great*. The only way I see them getting to the SB is if they somehow lock down the 1 seed.

10. Houston - Houston has figured a lot of things out this season and improved in a lot of areas. They’re scary but I don’t really trust them yet. I think the defense is gonna be the key to their season if they want to make a real run.

11. Dallas - Regardless of what you think of Dallas this is still a very talented team with weapons to win one on one matchups across the board against anyone and an emerging franchise QB. They will still likely get a home playoff game and will be a tough out.

12. Oakland - Like their offense. Running game can travel and it seems like Carr is having a nice year and playing great on third down, which is exactly what this team needs. 

13. Indy - Well coached, improving defense, not gonna scare anyone but teams need to be prepared if you want to beat them. Maybe a dark horse if they can sneak in the AFC playoffs.

14. LA Rams - This is still a talented team that I think people are slightly overreacting to their problems. If they can fix the offensive line issue I think it could be a huge catalyst for this team. Yes, Goff isn’t as good as we might’ve thought. This team can still win games with their defense and I think they will have somewhat of a bounce back next year if they play their cards right. 

15. Philly - I don’t trust Philly at all this year but I’m putting them here above Chicago, Pittsburgh, or Tennessee because I think Wentz gives his team a higher ceiling. Disappointing year but due the NFC Least they are still a factor and a factor to be reckoned with if they can figure shit out imo.

Michael Thomas, WR for the New Orleans Saints, out of The Ohio State University, has the most plays where the Quarterback threw the ball and the receiver caught it, and ended up 15 yards or more past the line of scrimmage.

Under the Saints he can be provided a consistent O-Line and offensive weapons(MT, Kamara, and Cook) which can be exactly what he needs to thrive.

Like that talk was fine from about December last year (when CJ Anderson came on board) through the Super Bowl. 

But we’ve known the story since just after the Super Bowl: that Todd Gurley has arthritis in one or both knees and therefore he cannot be a bellcow back any longer, or even play every series of the game. The man sits for multiple drives every game to rest him for the 4th quarter.

Why are we still speculating as if we don’t know? We know. The dude’s career as a lead runner is effectively over. Even in the rare games he gets 25-30 touches he’s still not the featured back and gets lots of touches through the air. As sad as it is, this man will never have another 30 carry game and the number of 20 carry games left in his career you can count on one hand. Arthritis isn’t an injury, the guy is not injured, he’s healthy aside from his arthritic knee(s).

""Worst QB Turnover luck (amount of INTs vs Turnover Worthy Passes)    
1. Ryan Fitzpatrick (+4)   
2T. Baker Mayfield (+3)   
2T. Dwayne Haskins (+3)   
2T. Ryan Tannehill (+3)   
5T. Russell Wilson (+1)   
5T. Drew Brees (+1)   


Best Turnover Luck: (how many fewer INTs than TWP)    
1. Daniel Jones (-9)   
2T. Jared Goff (-7)   
2T. Josh Allen (-7)   
2T. Mitchell Trubisky (-7)    
5T. Philip Rivers (-6)   
5T. Kyle Allen (-6)   
5T. Carson Wentz (-6)   
8. Dak Prescott (-5)""  


It makes you think how different narratives would be, like how different it would be if Baker was just a tad bit luckier and if Daniel Jones hadn't caught too many breaks.

I just don’t see any of the hype, just because he plays a “little bit” of special teams suddenly he’s a star player?  He would be cut from any roster for lack of talent.  He is not exceptional in any category, rushing, receiving, throwing, game management, hell he can’t even play defense.  The Saints could pick up Kaepernick or Dez Bryant right now, but are too stupid to cut Taysom Hill.

Rosters are set like a Pro Bowl roster both in position types and quantity (given enough players): 3 QBs, 3 RBs, 1 FB, 4 WRs, 2 TEs, 3 OTs, 3 OGs, 2 Cs, 3 DEs, 3 DTs, 3 OLBs, 2 ILBs, 4 CBs, 2 Ss, 1 K, 1P, 1 RS, 1 LS

This is done using only current players, so some teams are incomplete or missing positions due to lack of quantity. Players are selected based on ESPN's list of players by college

Players selected are based on Madden rating, if you think someone was missing let me know. How good do you think this team would be?

What do you think?

Forethought: I'm lumping the ***Baltimore Ravens*** in here as a note and not a post for one reason: They're team is exceptionally underwhelming.

11,It's time to separate out the QBs and give them their own award. MVP and OPOY are completely QB dominated.,"Yes. I know what you're saying. ""The QBs are clearly the most valuable players, and therefore, giving them the MVP makes sense"".

Yes. You're right. So let's acknowledge this and give them their own award. Call it whatever you'd like. From 07-now, there has only been 1 non QB MVP. Adrian Peterson in 2012.

But here's my biggest gripe. People often say that the OPOY is more of an award that encompasses all positions and doesn't take the ""valuable"" tag to heart. Yet from 07-now, 8 of the 12 OPOY winners have been QBs as well. Furthermore, 7 of the 12 have also been the same person who won MVP. All QBs and RBs. We have to go back to 93 for a different position to win it. Jerry Rice of course. Who else? This is despite some truly historic seasons from some true superstars. Calvin Johnson in 2012 got ""only"" a first team all pro nod for nearly eclipsing 2,000 yards. Peterson snagged both the OPOY and MVP that season. Kittle and Kelce both had historic seasons last year at the TE position, as did Gronk in 2011. Gronk was passed over for a QB in Brees for OPOY and Kelce and Kittle last year saw Mahomes, who also won MVP, take OPOY.

Let's change the system a bit. We all acknowledge the QBs are important. No matter what any other position does, they probably aren't as valuable as the 10th best QB in any given season. Remove the QBs from winning the OPOY award and change the name of the MVP award to something else. A RB shouldn't be the only position that has a chance to win either award and they shouldn't have to have an insanely historic season to even have a chance to top a QB.

&amp;nbsp;

#Pete Carmichael, Saints Offensive Coordinator (Age: 48)

*Career History: Browns Tight Ends Coach 2000, Redskins Offensive Assistant 2001, Chargers Offensive Assistant 2002-2003, Chargers Assistant Wide Receivers Coach 2004-2005, Saints Quarterbacks Coach 2006-2008, Saints Offensive Coordinator 2009-2019*

Pete Carmichael has cultivated a reputation for being one of the most creative offensive minds in all of football. As a 28-year old, Carmichael got his start as an assistant in Cleveland under his father, OC Pete Carmichael Sr, before spending four years under HC Marty Schottenheimer in Washington and San Diego. Carmichael then landed a job under new Saints HC Sean Payton in 2006. As the Saints' quarterbacks coach from 2006 to 2008, Carmichael was tasked with improving the play of QB Drew Brees, who had been written off by some after a tenuous tenure and gruesome injury with the Chargers. Carmichael did so with flying colors, as the 27-year-old passer improved from being cast off in 2005 to making First Team All Pro in 2006. Brees then went on to have successful seasons in 2007 and 2008, prompting the Saints to promote Pete Carmichael to offensive coordinator in 2009. Success shortly followed, as Carmichael's 2009 offense would finish ranked number 1 in total offense, and, despite a defense that finished ranked number 25 in total defense, the Saints won the Super Bowl that season. Since that historic 2009 season, Carmichael's offense has hardly taken a step back. From 2009 to 2018, the Saints' offense ranked number 1 or number 2 in total offense seven times, and Carmichael has not been afraid to tailor his offense to his personnel. Carmichael's offense puts pressure on safeties and prioritizes favorable down-and-distance combinations in the passing game by emphasizing the short-passing game and the screen game, it puts pressure on linebackers by ensuring that its running backs and tight ends have extensive route trees, and it primarily utilizes zone blocking. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Brian Daboll, Bills Offensive Coordinator (Age: 45)

*Career History: Patriots Defensive Assistant 2000-2001, Patriots Wide Receivers Coach 2002-2006, Jets Quarterbacks Coach 2007-2008, Browns Offensive Coordinator 2009-2010, Dolphins Offensive Coordinator 2011, Chiefs Offensive Coordinator 2012, Patriots Assistant Coach 2013, Patriots Tight Ends Coach 2014-2016, Alabama Offensive Coordinator 2017, Bills Offensive Coordinator 2018-2019*

Brian Daboll may not be the hottest head coach candidate amongst casual fans, but it has become clear over the past decade that he consistently excels in situating his unit to succeed and getting good development from his personnel. Daboll started out as a defensive assistant under Patriots HC Bill Belichick before taking a job as the Patriots wide receivers coach from 2002 to 2006. During his tenure, Daboll not only developed young WR Deion Branch into an above-average starter, but he also got above-average production from relative unknowns including WR David Patten, WR David Givens, and WR Reche Caldwell, as well. Daboll's work with mediocre talent earned him a position as quarterbacks coach of the Jets, where, in 2008, he coached QB Brett Favre to a Pro Bowl appearance at the age of 38. Daboll then got an opportunity to be offensive coordinator of the Browns under HC Eric Mangini. In 2010, with QB Jake Delhome, QB Seneca Wallace, and rookie QB Colt McCoy at the helm, Daboll got creative and converted RB Peyton Hillis from a fullback into a halfback, resulting in a breakout season with over 1000 yards rushing and over 400 yards receiving. Moreover, that season, Daboll got good production out of aging T John St. Clair and IOL Floyd Womack, who complemented T Joe Thomas and IOL Alex Mack to form one of the better offensive lines in football. Daboll then had two single-year stints, one with Miami and the other with Kansas City, as an offensive coordinator with low-quality quarterbacks. Daboll then spent 2014 through 2016 as the Patriots tight ends coach, and TE Rob Gronkowski made First Team All Pro in two of those three seasons. This performance earned Daboll a job as the Alabama offensive coordinator in 2017, where he coached good seasons from QB Jalen Hurts and freshman QB Tua Tagovailoa on his way to a National Championship victory. Buffalo hired Daboll to be its offensive coordinator in 2018, and despite perhaps lackluster statistics, its offense was dynamic with rookie QB Josh Allen's big arm and running ability, with WR Zay Jones' big-play ability, with the emergence of undrafted rookie WR Robert Foster. Additionally, QB Josh Allen made big strides with his mechanics, as his footwork and arm angles were definitely more consistent in his rookie years than they were at Wyoming. Daboll's offense seems to have finally taken off in 2019, as the additions of WR John Brown, WR Cole Beasley, IOL Mitch Morse, and IOL Jon Feliciano and the further development of QB Josh Allen have allowed for Daboll to have more freedom in his offensive playcalls. Daboll runs a hybrid offense between traditional Erhardt-Perkins dropback concepts and modern West Coast misdirection and play action concepts, which allows him to specifically mold his weekly gameplans to his opponents and his available personnel. 

&amp;nbsp;

#John DeFilippo, Jaguars Offensive Coordinator (Age: 42)

*Career History: Giants Offensive Quality Coach 2005-2006, Raiders Quarterbacks Coach 2007-2008, Jets Quarterbacks Coach 2009, San Jose State Quarterbacks Coach 2010, San Jose State Offenvie Coordinator 2011, Raiders Quarterbacks Coach 2012-2014, Browns Offensive Coordinator 2015, Eagles Quarterbacks Coach 2016-2017, Vikings Offensive Coordinator 2018, Jaguars Offensive Coordinator 2019*

John DeFilippo has been around the league for a while, and he has cultivated a reputation for being a so-called quarterback-whisperer. DeFilippo got his start with the Giants as an offensive quality control coach in 2005 under HC Tom Coughlin, where he worked to develop second-year QB Eli Manning into one of the more reliable quarterbacks in football. DeFilippo's work with Manning landed him the title of quarterbacks coach of the Raiders in 2007, where he worked under HC Lane Kiffin and OC Greg Knapp to develop rookie QB JaMarcus Russell. Though Russell never became a franchise quarterback, he did have the best two years of his career in 2007 and 2008 under DeFilippo before falling off in 2009 without DeFilippo. In 2009, DeFilippo took a job as the quarterbacks coach of the Jets, where he worked with rookie QB Mark Sanchez. DeFilippo spent two years with San Jose State before retaking the Raiders quarterbacks coach position between 2012 and 2014. In 2012, DeFilippo helped to orchestrate a good year from QB Carson Palmer, who threw for over 4000 yards for the first time since 2007. DeFilippo worked under OC Greg Olson with second-round rookie QB Derek Carr in 2014, who performed well in his first season despite a lackluster supporting cast. DeFilippo's work with Palmer and Carr earned him the Browns offensive coordinator job in 2015, where he worked for a year before becoming the Eagles' quarterbacks coach under HC Doug Pederson and OC Frank Reich in 2016. DeFilippo helped transform QB Carson Wentz from a raw North Dakota St prospect into a proficient passer off the bat in 2016, and then into a Second Team All Pro in 2017. Further, in 2017, after Wentz went down with a late-season injury, backup QB Nick Foles filled in masterfully, leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory. This impressive feat led to DeFilippo becoming the Vikings offensive coordinator in 2018, where he led QB Kirk Cousins to a career high in completion percentage and WR Adam Thielen and WR Stefon Diggs to career highs in receiving yards. In 2019, DeFilippo became the Jaguars offensive coordinator under HC Doug Marrone, and history repeated itself -- this time, QB Nick Foles went down early with a serious injury, and backup QB Gardner Minshew took over without missing a beat. DeFilippo is a pass-happy coordinator who has been around a diverse set of offensive minds, including Brian Schottenheimer, Greg Olson, Tom Cable, Doug Pederson, and Frank Reich, so he has a wide arsenal, including run-pass options, Air Raid concepts, screens, and varied shotgun looks, to tailor his offense particularly to his quarterback's skillset. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Matt Eberflus, Colts Defensive Coordinator (Age: 49)

*Career History: Toledo Outside Linebackers Coach 1994-1998, Toledo Defensive Backs Coach 1999-2000, Missouri Defensive Coordinator 2001-2008, Browns Linebackers Coach 2009-2010, Cowboys Linebackers Coach 2011-2017, Colts Defensive Coordinator 2018-2019*

Matt Eberflus hasn't necessarily always been amongst the so-called hottest candidates, but his work, especially over the last few years, may warrant head coach consideration. Eberflus got his start at the age of 23 as a defensive assistant at Toledo in 1994, where he would stay for seven years before becoming Missouri's defensive coordinator in 2001. That year, Eberflus produced the great IDL Justin Smith, who became the number four overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft and played 14 seasons in the NFL. Under Eberflus', the Missouri defense improved for four straight seasons, culminating in a dominant which yielded less than 20 points per game on average. Eberflus had a respectable tenure as defensive coordinator at Missouri before moving to the NFL and becoming the Browns linebackers coach in 2009. Eberflus spent two seasons under HC Eric Mangini and DC Rob Ryan in Cleveland before following Ryan to become the Cowboys linebackers coach in 2016. That season, under Eberflus, 24-year-old LB Sean Lee recorded over 100 tackles, and EDGE DeMarcus Lawrence recorded 19.5 sacks and made First Team All Pro. Further, Eberflus worked to develop young LB Bruce Carter, who eventually became a good starter for the Cowboys. In 2014, following LB Sean Lee's season-ending injury, Eberflus was forced to start LB Bruce Carter, LB Anthony Hitchens, a fourth-round rookie, and LB Rolando McClain, who was previously seen as a draft bust and had spent the previous year in retirement. Nevertheless, Carter, Hitchens, and McClain still performed well as a unit in 2014 under Eberflus, as the unit combined for 8 interceptions and 15 pass deflections, and each starting linebacker recorded over 80 tackles. In 2016, the Cowboys promoted Eberflus to defensive pass game coordinator, where he took on some playcalling responsibilities. That year, under Eberflus, LB Sean Lee recorded 175 tackles and made First Team All Pro, and the Cowboys went 13-3 and won the NFC East. In 2018, the Colts hired Matt Eberflus to be their defensive coordinator, and he immediately began to implement a turnaround. In his first year with Indianapolis, Eberflus transformed Indianapolis' defense from being ranked number 30 in total defense to being ranked number 11 in total defense, and he coached second-round rookie LB Darius Leonard to make First Team All Pro. Eberflus' defense has continued to perform well in 2019. Matt Eberflus has a wide defensive arsenal from working with other defensive minds such as Rod Marinelli, Kris Richard, and Monte Kiffin, and with Indianapolis, he runs a zone-heavy, 4-3 defense with frequent blitzes and a high percentage of cover 2 calls. 

&amp;nbsp;

#George Edwards, Vikings Defensive Coordinator (Age: 53)

*Career History: Cowboys Linebackers Coach 1998-2001, Redskins Linebackers Coach 2002, Redskins Defensive Coordinator 2003, Browns Linebackers Coach 2004, Dolphins Linebackers Coach 2005-2009, Bills Defensive Coordinator 2010-2011, Dolphins Linebackers Coach 2012-2013, Vikings Defensive Coordinator 2014-2019*

George Edwards has bounced around the league a lot since his first NFL job in 1998, but he has quietly been very successful. Edwards got his start in Dallas in 1998, and he shortly developed LB Dexter Coakley into one of the best coverage linebackers in the entire league. With Edwards as his position coach, Coakley made the Pro Bowl in 1999 with 4 interceptions, 1 forced fumble, and 6 tackles for loss. In 2002, Edwards was responsible for overseeing a dominant Redskins' linebacking crew under DC Marvin Lewis that included LB Jim Trottier and LB Lavar Arrington, the latter of whom recorded a career-best 11 sacks that season. At the age of 36, Edwards got his first chance to run a defense with Washington before catching on with Cleveland as their linebackers coach in 2004. Edwards' career really took off from 2005 through 2009 as the linebackers coach of the Dolphins, as he oversaw a dominant linebacking group consisting of LB Zach Thomas, EDGE Joey Porter, and EDGE Jason Taylor. Edwards helped coach the Dolphins through a 4-3 to 3-4 scheme switch, and he developed LB Channing Crowder from a round 3 draft choice into a good starter on day one. Edwards' developmental abilities landed him a job in Buffalo as defensive coordinator in 2010 and 2011, where he ran a dynamic defense with young stars such as IDL Kyle Williams, IDL Marcell Dareus, LB Paul Posluszny, S Donte Whitner, and S Jairus Byrd. Edwards then spent two years with the Dolphins before reuniting with HC Mike Zimmer in Minnesota. In 2014, Zimmer and Edwards transformed Minnesota's defense from being ranked number 31 in total defense to being ranked 14 in total defense. In each of 2016, 2017, and 2018, Zimmer and Edwards' defense ranked top 4 in total defense, constantly shape-shifting their vast array of talent including EDGE Danielle Hunter, EDGE Everson Griffin, IDL Linval Joseph, LB Anthony Barr, LB Eric Kendricks, CB Xavier Rhodes, S Harrison Smith, and S Anthony Harris to specifically attack their opponent. Edwards runs a 4-3 defense with lots of MOFC coverages and pattern-match concepts, and he likes to crowd the line of scrimmage and the A gap to make offenses have to account for the threat of the blitz. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Mike McDaniel, 49ers Offensive Run Game Coordinator (Age: 37)

*Career History: Broncos Coaching Intern 2005, Texans Offensive Assistant 2006-2008, Sacramento Running Backs Coach 2009-2010, Redskins Offensive Assistant 2011-2012, Redskins Wide Receivers Coach 2013, Browns Wide Receivers Coach 2014, Falcons Offensive Assistant 2015-2016, 49ers Run Game Coordinator 2017-2019*

Mike McDaniel figures to draw some interest for head coach positions due to his associations with great offenses and great offensive minds. McDaniel spent three years as an assistant under Gary Kubiak in Houston and two years coaching in the UFL before finding an assistant job under HC Mike Shanahan and OC Kyle Shanahan in Washington at the age of 28. The Washington staffs that McDaniel was a part of were loaded with great offensive minds aside from the Shanahans, as well, as they contained quarterbacks coach Matt LaFleur and tight ends coach Sean McVay as well. In 2011, with QB Rex Grossman, RB Roy Helu, WR Santana Moss, WR Jabar Gaffney, and TE Fred Davis as the primary skill position players and with a patchwork offensive line riddled with injuries, the Redskins ranked number 16 in total offense. The Washington staff would showcase its versatility over the next two seasons, as it molded its offense to fit the skillset of young QB Robert Griffin III, finishing ranked in the top 10 in total offense in 2012 and 2013. McDaniel was promoted to wide receivers coach in 2013, and he coached WR Pierre Garcon and WR Leonard Hankerson to career highs in receiving yards that season. In 2014, McDaniel followed OC Kyle Shanahan to Cleveland to become their wide receivers coach. That season, under McDaniel, WR Andrew Hawkins set a career-high mark for receiving yards despite being thrown to by QB Brian Hoyer and QB Johnny Manziel, and undrafted rookie WR Taylor Gabriel emerged as a dynamic receiving weapon. McDaniel then followed OC Kyle Shanahan to Atlanta to become an offensive assistant in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, WR Julio Jones led the league in receiving yards, RB Devonta Freeman and RB Patrick DiMarco made the Pro Bowl, and the Falcons finished ranked number 7 in total offense. In 2016, the Falcons had a historic offense, as QB Matt Ryan won the MVP award and made First Team All Pro, WR Julio Jones made First Team All Pro, IOL Alex Mack made Second Team All Pro, they ranked number 2 in total offense, and they made Super Bowl LI. This showing earned Kyle Shanahan a head coach position with San Francisco, and, as Shanahan did not hire an offensive coordinator, Mike McDaniel is considered to be his top offensive assistant in San Francisco as his offensive run game coordinator. In 2017 and 2018, Shanahan and McDaniel's offensive unit finished ranked in the top half of the league in total offense, despite starting QB CJ Beathard, QB Brian Hoyer, and QB Nick Mullens for a combined 24 out of 32 games. Shanahan and McDaniel molded their offense around TE George Kittle, whose 2018 receiving yards mark is currently the all-time most receiving yards for a tight end in a season. The tandem managed to get good production out of relative unknowns such as RB Matt Brieda, WR Dante Pettis, T Mike McGlinchey, and IOL Laken Tomlinson. Finally, in 2019, with starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo, Shanahan and McDaniel appear to have put together the pieces, as their offense is amongst the most prolific in the league this season. Mike McDaniel comes straight from the Shanahan branch of the West Coast Offense, so he could be expected to run an outside zone running scheme, to heavily utilize play action and misdirection, and to stretch the field with screens and bootleg throwbacks, while also tailoring his offense to fit his personnel.

#Josh McDaniels, Patriots Offensive Coordinator (Age: 44)

*Career History: Patriots Personnel Assistant 2001, Patriots Defensive Assistant 2002-2003, Patriots Quarterbacks Coach 2004-2005, Patriots Offensive Coordinator 2006-2008, Broncos Head Coach 2009-2010, Rams Offensive Coordinator 2011, Patriots Offensive Coordinator 2012-2019*

Even as a young coach, Josh McDaniels has a diverse, successful coaching resume, having spent time on offense, defense, and as an NFL head coach, and having won six Super Bowls. McDaniels got his start in 2001 under HC Bill Belichick as a personnel assistant for the Patriots at the age of 25. McDaniels would spend three years as an assistant for the Patriots, mostly on the defensive side of the football, before being promoted to the Patriots quarterbacks coach in 2004 at the young age of 28. That year, under McDaniels, 26-year-old QB Tom Brady had the most efficient year of his career up to that point, and the Patriots went 14-2 and won the Super Bowl. McDaniels spent 2005 as Brady's quarterbacks coach before his promotion to offensive coordinator in 2006. During McDaniels' first stint as the Patriots offensive coordinator, McDaniels' unit finished ranked top five in total offense twice, including a historic 2007 season, where his offense finished ranked number 1 in total offense, and the Patriots went undefeated in regular season games. This success prompted the Broncos to hire McDaniels to be their head coach in 2009. McDaniels spent two seasons as the head coach of the Broncos, and the Broncos finished ranked in the top half in total offense each year, despite starting QB Kyle Orton and a pedestrian offensive line in the vast majority of games. McDaniels' Broncos would finish 4-12 in 2010, largely due to a defense which finished ranked number 32 in total defense, prompting the Broncos to fire McDaniels. Josh McDaniels then had a one-year stint with the Rams in 2011 before returning to be the Patriots offensive coordinator in 2012, a position in which McDaniels remains currently employed. From 2012 to 2018, McDaniels' Patriots finished ranked in the top 10 in total offense in six of seven seasons, QB Tom Brady made the Pro Bowl in each season, the Patriots averaged over 12 wins per season, and the Patriots won the Super Bowl three times. McDaniels' offense has continued to perform at about the same clip in 2019. McDaniels runs the Erhardt-Perkins offense perhaps better than any other offensive coach in history, creating mismatches with deceptive formations and personnel groupings and consistently staying ahead of his opponents with mid-season and in-game adjustments, so he should continue to garner massive interest for any team with a head coach vacancy in 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Urban Meyer, Former Ohio State Head Coach (Age: 55)

*Career History: Illinois State Outside Linebackers Coach 1988, Illinois State Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers Coach 1989, Colorado State Wide Receivers Coach 1990-1995, Notre Dame Wide Receivers Coach 1996-2000, Bowling Green Head Coach 2001-2002, Utah Head Coach 2003-2004, Florida Head Coach 2005-2010, Ohio State Head Coach 2012-2018*

Urban Meyer probably falls into the category of college coaches that could get an NFL head coach job easily if they express interest, and for good reason. Meyer got his start at the age of 23 as the Illinois State outside linebackers coach in 1988. Meyer would remain an assistant coach for 13 years before landing a head coach position with Bowling Green in 2001. Meyer improved Bowling Green from a 2-9 team to an 8-3 team in year one, and he went 9-3 in year two averaging over 40 points scored per game. Meyer then went on to orchestrate a similar turnaround in Utah, improving the 5-6 team to a 10-2 team in year one and going 12-0 in year two while averaging over 45 points scored per game. Meyer's quarterback in 2004, QB Alex Smith, came in fourth place in Heisman voting and became the number one overall selection in the 2005 NFL Draft. Meyer's work with Bowling Green and Utah earned him a premier head coach position with the Florida Gators from 2005 to 2010. During this 6-year span, Meyer went 65-15, winning 2 BCS Championships and producing four offensive round-one draft picks in QB Tim Tebow, WR Percy Harvin, IOL Maurkice Pouncey, and IOL Mike Pouncey, along with other notable offensive draft picks such as WR Riley Cooper, TE Aaron Hernandez, and T Marcus Gilbert. Meyer resigned from the Florida head coach position after the 2010 season due to health reasons, but he resurfaced as head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes in 2012. In that very first year, Meyer transformed Ohio State from a 6-7 team to a 12-0 team. Meyer would ultimately go 83-9 with Ohio State, winning a National Championship and producing notable offensive players including QB Dwayne Haskins, QB Cardale Jones, RB Ezekiel Elliott, RB Carlos Hyde, WR Michael Thomas, WR Terry McLaurin, WR Parris Campbell, T Taylor Decker, and IOL Billy Price. Meyer, long-considered to be an offensive guru, prefers to run an offense with a mobile quarterback to incorporate read option plays, but at its core, Meyer's offense is a vertically-oriented, pass-happy attack with a gap-blocking scheme in the run game. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Greg Olson, Raiders Offensive Coordinator (Age: 57)

*Career History: 49ers Quarterbacks Coach 2001, Purdue Tight Ends Coach 2002, Bears Quarterbacks Coach 2003, Lions Quarterbacks Coach 2004, Lions Offensive Coordinator 2005, Rams Offensive Coordinator 2006-2007, Buccaneers Quarterbacks Coach 2008, Buccaneers Offensive Coordinator 2009-2011, Jaguars Quarterbacks Coach 2012, Raiders Offensive Coordinator 2013-2014, Jaguars Offensive Coordinator 2015-2016, Rams Quarterbacks Coach 2017, Raiders Offensive Coordinator 2018-2019*

After many years of being an assistant under some of the most respected NFL minds of our generation and successfully working with many young quarterbacks, it may finally be time for Greg Olson to break through and get a head coach job opportunity of his own. Olson started his NFL career at the age of 38 as the quarterbacks coach of the 49ers under HC Steve Mariucci in 2001. Under Olson, QB Jeff Garcia made the Pro Bowl, and the 49ers went 12-4 and made the postseason. Olson spent 2002 with Purdue before becoming the Bears quarterbacks coach in 2003. Olson then took the Lions quarterbacks coach job in 2004, where he coached QB Joey Harrington to the most efficient passing season of his career. Olson then had a one-year sting as the Lions offensive coordinator before becoming the Rams offensive coordinator in 2006. Under Olson in 2006, the Rams finished ranked number 6 in total offense, and QB Marc Bulger made the Pro Bowl and had the most efficient passing season of his career. In 2008, Olson became the quarterbacks coach of the Buccaneers under HC Jon Gruden. In 2009, the Buccaneers promoted Greg Olson to offensive coordinator, and in 2010, 22-year-old QB Josh Freeman had the best season of his career, as he threw for 3451 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions, and he led the Buccaneers to a 10-6 season. Olson's work in Tampa Bay landed him the Raiders offensive coordinator job in 2013. During his stint with the Raiders, Olson worked closely with QB Derek Carr, who captured the starting quarterback job in his rookie season as a second-round pick. Olson then took the Jaguars offensive coordinator job in 2015. That season, 22-year-old QB Blake Bortles had the best season of his career, as he threw for 4428 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. Olson then took the Rams quarterbacks coach job under HC Sean McVay in 2017. That year, Olson worked closely with 22-year-old QB Jared Goff, who transformed from a presumed draft bust into a Pro Bowl player in a single season. Raiders HC Jon Gruden then hired Olson to be his offensive coordinator in 2018. Greg Olson has consistently proven that he will get the most out of his quarterbacks, so he could generate some interest from teams who wish to develop their young quarterbacks. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Kris Richard, Cowboys Defensive Pass Game Coordinator (Age: 40)

*Career History: Seahawks Assistant Defensive Backs Coach 2010, Seahawks Cornerbacks Coach 2011, Seahawks Defensive Backs Coach 2012-2014, Seahawks Defensive Coordinator 2015-2017, Cowboys Pass Game Coordinator 2018-2019*

Despite being only 40 years old, Kris Richard's resume might be the most impressive of any aspiring head coach's in the NFL today. As Seattle's cornerbacks coach in 2011 and defensive backs coach in 2012 and 2013, Richard transformed CB Brandon Browner from a CFL player to an NFL Pro Bowler in a year, he developed CB Byron Maxwell from a sixth-round pick to a solid starter, and he developed CB Richard Sherman from a fifth-round pick to an all-time great. During Richard's time as defensive backs coach of the Seahawks, CB Richard Sherman and S Earl Thomas each made First Team All Pro three times, and S Kam Chancellor made Second Team All Pro once. In 2015, Richard was promoted to defensive coordinator of the Seahawks, a position in which he remained for three years. From 2015 to 2017, Richard's defense finished ranked number 2, 5, and 11 in total defense, respectively, and the Seahawks made the divisional round of the playoffs in two out of three years. In 2018, Richard left Seattle to take a job with Dallas as the defensive backs coach and the defensive pass game coordinator, an important position which included the responsibility of playcalling. Under Richard in 2018, Dallas' defense ranked number 7 in total defense, and CB Byron Jones transformed from a safety to making a Second Team All Pro as a corner in one year. With Richard calling plays once again, Dallas' defense has continued to perform at a high level in 2019. Kris Richard, like Pete Carroll, Gus Bradley, and Dan Quinn, is a zone-heavy coach who primarily uses cover 3, and in his front seven he uses a 4-3. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Robert Saleh, 49ers Defensive Coordinator (Age: 41)

*Career History: Texans Defensive Intern 2005, Texans Defensive Quality Coach 2006-2008, Texans Assistant Linebackers Coach 2009-2010, Seahawks Defensive Quality Control Coach 2011-2013, Jaguars Linebackers Coach 2014-2016, 49ers Defensive Coordinator 2017-2019*

Robert Saleh has been all over the country in his 15-year NFL coaching career, and he has cultivated a reputation for being an innovative defensive mind. Saleh got his start as a 25 year old as a defensive intern for the Texans under HC Dom Capers and DC Vic Fangio. Saleh stuck with the team for four years before being named the Texans assistant linebackers coach in 2009. That season, 22-year-old LB Brian Cushing and 24-year-old LB DeMeco Ryans both qualified for the Pro Bowl. Saleh then took an opportunity to coach under HC Pete Carroll as a defensive quality control coach in 2011. Saleh was part of the Seahawks' defensive staff for a dominant three-year stretch, the last of which saw the Seahawks finish ranked number 1 in total defense, resulting in a Super Bowl victory. In 2014, Saleh followed Gus Bradley to Jacksonville to become the Jaguars linebackers coach, a position in which he would remain for three seasons. In Saleh's first year with the team, he oversaw fifth-round-rookie LB Telvin Smith record over 100 tackles and develop into a good coverage player as well. Saleh would then coach LB Telvin Smith and LB Paul Posluszny to successful seasons in 2015 and 2016 before HC Kyle Shanahan poached him to be the 49ers defensive coordinator in 2017. In 2017, Saleh improved the 49ers defense from being ranked number 32 in total defense to being ranked number 24 in total defense. Saleh's unit finished ranked number 13 in total defense in 2018, with 24-year-old IDL DeForest Buckner recording 12 sacks and qualifying for the Pro Bowl. Saleh's defense has gotten off to a dominant start in 2019, pairing a swarming defensive front consisting of EDGE Nick Bosa, EDGE Arik Armstead, IDL DeForest Buckner, and LB Kwon Alexander with a surprising secondary consisting of CB Richard Sherman, CB Ahkello Witherspoon, and S Jimmie Ward. Robert Saleh primarily runs a Seattle 3 defense like the one he learned under HC Pete Carroll, but he mixes in two-deep looks as well with some wide-9 and stacked alignments in the front seven. 

&amp;nbsp;

#David Shaw, Stanford Head Coach (Age: 47)

*Career History: Eagles Quality Control Coach 1997, Raiders Quality Control Coach 1998-2000, Raiders Quarterbacks Coach 2001, Ravens Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers Coach 2002-2004, Ravens Wide Receivers Coach 2005, Chargers Passing Game Coordinator 2006, Stanford Offensive Coordinator 2007-2010, Stanford Head Coach 2011-2019*

David Shaw falls into the select groups of people that could probably generate NFL head coach offers for multiple teams the instant that he shows interest, and for good reason -- Shaw has consistently produced high-level offensive results ever since he started coaching football. Shaw got his NFL start in 1997 at 23 years old as a quality control coach on an Eagles offensive staff headlined by OC Jon Gruden and quarterbacks coach Sean Payton. Shaw followed Gruden to become a quality control coach for the Raiders from 1998 to 2000 before finally being named the Raiders quarterbacks coach in 2001. Under Shaw in 2001, QB Rich Gannon made the Pro Bowl, leading the Raiders to 10 wins and the second round of the postseason. In 2002, Shaw went to Baltimore to become the Ravens quarterbacks and wide receivers coach under HC Brian Billick. Shaw spent four years in Baltimore before becoming the Chargers passing game coordinator in 2006. That season, with Shaw, the Chargers finished ranked number 4 in total offense, going 14-2 and winning the AFC West. Shaw then took the opportunity to become the offensive coordinator at his alma mater, Stanford University, under HC Jim Harbaugh in 2007. Shaw transformed Stanfords offense from scoring 10.6 points per game in 2006 to scoring over 40 points per game in 2010. Shaw was named Stanford's head coach in 2011. Between 2010 and 2018, Shaw's team finished in the top 10 three separate times, his offense scored over 30 points per game four separate times, and he had an overall winning percentage of 0.759. Shaw has produced NFL offensive talent during his Stanford tenure as well, including QB Andrew Luck, RB Christian McCaffrey, TE Zach Ertz, and IOL David DeCastro. If David Shaw were to jump back to the NFL, he would certainly present new challenges for defensive coordinators, as he combines traditional West Coast staples with spread concepts in ways unlike current NFL offensive play callers with impressive flexibility on a week-to-week basis.",nfl,PM-ME-A-PRIME-NUMBER,63,2019-11-14

84,[OC] A statistical analysis of Tom Brady’s Outlier of a career,"In Brady’s last 19 seasons he has a winning percentage of .779. The average winning percentage for all 32 franchise is .50025. If we adjust his winning percentage down to compensate for the outlier to a generous .532 (Still above league average) than he’ll average a much more reasonable 8.512 wins per season instead of 12.464 wins per season 

The next outlier is career length. Tom Brady is entering his 20th year as an nfl quarterback. The average career length for a quarterback is three years. This is an extremely flukey stat. Let’s adjust his career to a more reasonable 13 years instead of 20. That still gives him a longer career length than titans of the game like Kyle Orton

Brady’s stats are also riddled with statistical outliers. 

Lets start with attempts. The league average in pass attempts over Tom Brady’s career is 471.05. Let’s be generous and adjust this to 485 for Brady per season 

Next we’ll do completions. The league average for completions across Brady’s career is 286. Again we’ll help him out and give 306. That’s pretty above average. That’ll give him an average completion percentage of 63.09% across a season

TD percentage is next. The average TD % across Brady’s career is 4.27%. We’ll give him a 4.4 TD%. That’d have him average 21.34 TDs per season. Much more reasonable 

Now we’re gonna adjust his Int %. The average across his career is 2.76. We’ll compensate for that by putting his at 2.25. So he’d average 10.9 Ints per season.

We’ll finish with Y/A. The average across Brady’s career is 7.04. Let’s be generous and give him an average of 7.56 yards per attempt. This means he’d average 3668 yards per season.

So let’s look at his season average all together. When adjusted for outliers, Tom Brady’s average season looks like this: 306/485 3668 yards 21 TDs 11 Ints a 63% completion percentage and a 91.16 passer rating.

Extrapolate that based on his adjusted career length and Tom Brady ends up with 47686 yards, 111 wins 273 TDs and 143 Ints instead of his gaudy, and flukey 215 wins, 531 TDs and 73000 yards

Let’s say you don’t correctly adjust his career. Well even over his 19 year (omitting year 20 because it isn’t complete yet) with the correctly adjusted stats he’d have 161 wins, 399 TDs and 69696 (nice) career yards.

Lastly, During Tom Brady’s career 19 Super Bowls have been played. He’s won 6 of them which is extremely flukey. The ideal average amount of super bowl wins for each franchise is .594 Super Bowls per team. With that in mind, we’ll be nice to Brady and round that way above average to 1

So what does this tell us?

Simply put, when you adjust Brady’s stats to by removing the outlier numbers then he has roughly the career numbers and per season averages of Carson Palmer. The “GOAT” qb’s career is heavily inflated by flukeyness and his stats and accomplishments should be taken with a grain of salt.

If you haven’t been here with me before, the concept is both simple and *fantastically* over-engineered. Lemme break it down:

* Each punter’s performance against **five vital punting metrics** is ranked against every other punter in the league.
* Those rankings are **combined into a weighted average ranking** – the 2019 NFL Punt Rank. 
* Punt Heroes rise to the top; Punt Zeros sink to the bottom. 

This week on Punt Rank, we saw:

* A vintage performance by the most underrated player in the NFL;
* An unbelievably good fake punts;
* A truly terribly bad fake punt;
* The return of an old friend as the punting revolving door/career-vacuum in Atlanta suck in its newest member.

All this and the opportunity to be delighted/surprised/furious/downright miserable at how your team’s punter is doing in the 2019 season so far. Let’s get this show on the road...

# Good Week for

1. **Corey Bojorquez (BUF, +3 to #32).** Last week I roasted Corey Bojorquez. This week I get to say how well he did, which makes me feel good - like a teacher who helped their student finally overcome their issues with trig and pass out of high school math. Or at very least like sternly-buttoned Army Dad whose levels of affection are impossible to gauge at any given time but will hug you on your birthday and buy you a truck (USED TRUCK – DO YOU THINK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS SHITTING MONEY NOW ZACHARY?!) ‘just because’. This week Corey gets a pat on the head and a half-nod of appreciation for his **four punt, 75% In 20 (7, 15, 15), 50.5 Net Average Yardage (NAY)** day. Didn’t help the Bills beat the Browns, but you don’t win every war, kiddo. That’s what I told the boys as we were hotshittin’ it outta KEW-WAIT in Gulf I *\*slaps back unbearably hard\*.* How’s that truck drivin’? Good, good. See ya at dinner.
2. **Brett Kern (TEN, +1 to #2).** [Brett Kern](https://i.redd.it/wp8nfgimulp31.jpg) is the most underrated player in the NFL. Ask 100 NFL fans to name a punter – I bet you dollars to donuts none of them say Kern as their first though. But Kern, now in his 12th season in the league and 10th with Tennessee, is wildly consistently and freakishly skilled and goddamn deserves to be in that conversation. This week in the Titans’ shock victory over the Mahomes led Chiefs, Kern had **four punts at a NAY of 49.6.** But its more than the distance. Kern landed those punts at **the 8, the 4, the 18 (punting from his own 17 yard line!!) and the 21, covering 84%, 93%, 78% and 67% of available field, for an Average Field Coverage of 78%.** OK OK so he gave up five yards on that third punt and it ended up at the 23. It was still a huge performance, and he was only four fricken yards from having 100% inside the 20 (as it was he had to settle for 50%, slightly lowering his frankly ridiculous season total of **51.9%**). You wouldn’t bet against Kern making it to his third Pro Bowl in a row in 2019. Maybe he’s finally getting the recognition he deserves.
3. **Bradley Pinion (TB, +1 to #35).** Kern was great at 78% of Average Field Coverage. But Bradley Pinion was ever so slightly better. **49/56, 48/56, 43/64 – 79% of Average Available Field** covered on his best punting day of the year so far. Were it not for a two-yard Pharaoh Cooper return on his final boot he would have had all three punts inside the 20 as well. He’ll settle for **66.6%**, against his season average of 33.3%. GG, Bradders. Keep it up.

# Bad Week for

1. **Matt Haack (MIA, -11 to #18).** Ah, Haack Attack. It was all going so well last week. This week you fell foul of Chester Rogers’ happy feet (including a 21 yard return on a 41 yard boot) and a grim 38 yard touchback which was just plain overcooked. None of 5 inside the 20, NAY of 33.1 and all those return yards saw the Hawk drop in every Punt Rank metric, contributing to his 11 place slip overall. He’s still doing his best to Blow for Burrow, but the rest of these dudes just will NOT take a memo. 
2. **Michael Dickson (SEA, -7 to #36).** ***“****Michael Dickson punts 22 yards out of bounds”* has been a worryingly frequent return on the play logs this season. Dickson needs to find his way back to his rookie form, and fast, before this gets ugly.
3. **Dustin Colquitt (KC, -1 to #16).** Turn up, do one punt, 26 yards, back to the sideline, game check please. Colquitt has got this whole unimpeachable club legend thing nailed. Wadda ya gonna do, CUT ME?

# Punter revolving door of the week watch – Week 11

Hey you guys, **Ryan Allen (ATL)** is back! Done with the long harsh winters of New England (read: cut by Daddy when a sexy new option came along), Allen has decided to join the club of people who punt for the Falcons for like, three weeks, catch an incurable disease and then are never heard of again. Their fourth (FOURTH!!) punter of the year, Allen managed two boots for a (19 yard return affected) **NAY of 29.0, just 45% of Average Available Field**. Guess it takes some time to get back into it? At least he’s got two weeks left in his Falcons career to put things right.

Related note: much loved and missed Atlanta punters of the past **Kasey Redfern (#37) and Matt Bosher (#38)** are now our two lowest ranked punters this year. Whatever Dan Quinn is feeding these guys, he shouldn’t be. Please Dan, for Ryan’s sake.

# Punter Swag of the week – Week 10

**Andy Lee (ARI)** isn’t content with just being 63 years old and punting in the league since before the 1970 merger, he’s happy to [WHUP BOMBS](https://www.azcardinals.com/video/cardinals-pull-off-tricky-fake-punt-against-buccaneers) on a sweet flea flicker. All day, baby!!

Most electrifying QB in the NFL and MVP-elect Russell Wilson? Season QB Rating 114.9.

Geriatric punter and part-time cod liver oil spokesperson Andy Lee? QB Rating 118.8. 

I rest my case.

# Punt Drag of the week – Week 10

What did they do to my beautiful boy? The Rams’ once-feared offense ground to a halt once again this weekend in Pittsburgh, and so there was nothing for once in a generation offensive guru and future HOF innovator Sean McVay to do but do the same shit that JEFF FUCKEN FISHER used to do when the Rams couldn’t move the ball. That’s right, they asked **Johnny Hekker** to bail them out. Only this time, it went terribly, terribly wrong. Coming in to the game with a career QBR of 106, the bizarro screen play slash oh-no-this-is-busted-better-throw-it-to-a-lineman-who-isn’t-looking play that the Rams ended up running culminated in a **Hekker interception** (the first of his 21 career passes) and a slashing of his QBR down to **81.6**, and just **52.1 on the season so far (63rd in the NFL this year)**. 64th and 65th? Josh Rosen and Dwayne Haskins. They should be *honoured* to be in such illustrious company.

# Punt of the week – Week 10

Not only was **Sam Martin’s (DET)** punt from his own 48 an absolute nose-down-laces-out-watch-this-bounce beauty which was downed at the Bears 4 yard line for **92% of Average Field Coverage**, it was also downed by Dee Virgin which allows us to all smile wryly and pretend we’re above those jokes.

HIS NAME IS D VIRGIN YOU GUYS!!

Ah, shoot.

Guess I'll see you again next week for another round up of the best and worst in NFL Punting, and the hope that we get more special teamers with funny names. Until then…

You can see the Z, Y, H, X receivers on offense, what would the defense do if each ran vertical? The FS (free safety) would have to choose between the Y and H verticals up the seam. The Seahawks' answer is Soft Sky, where the FS would take the H's vertical and the SS would take the Y. It's kind of a Cover 3 zone that turns into Cover 4 after the snap.

He's averaging 1.5 sacks per game at home and 0.1666 on the road. His half a sack was vs the Chargers in what was practically a home game.

If you ignored his home/road split he's on pace for 16.8 sacks, but if the home-road split holds up you would predict 13.3.

264,Since when has “draft bust” meant “didn’t earn a second contract”?,"The phrase “bust” to me means you couldn’t survive on the NFL level for more than a year or two and are god-awful. Or in extreme cases like Ryan Leaf,  only played in a handful of games over several years, all of which were horrible.

But now I’m hearing Jameis and Marcus being called “draft busts”.  Like I get it, neither guy (#1 and #2 overall picks) earned a second contract. But they are absolutely unequivocally not draft busts.

After all, how can you win a playoff game and be considered a draft bust? If you were a draft bust you wouldn’t have sniffed the playoffs once. Even Jameis never sniffed the playoffs and is still not a bust. Yes both guys have been benched at times but the teams they play for (especially Tampa, which since 2009 has been a third-world type organization, the team hasn’t actually spent money or had a plan since they replaced Gruden with a neophyte-puppet a decade ago) leave a lot to be desired

There are relatively few true draft busts because all these first rounders are über talented. Even a half-ass effort is enough to keep them in the league. It’s only when they give zero effort that first rounders get cut.

And that’s basically where I’d draw the line between a bust and just disappointing: a disappointing player doesn’t get a second contract, a bust gets cut before he rookie deal is over",nfl,ThatOtherAA,87,2019-11-14

320,The saddest franchise in the nfl,"For me there are three that come to mind, the Lions, Cardinals and Tampa. They rank 24th 31st and 32nd respectively in all time win percentage and all three teams have been in the league for at least 40 years with the Buccs being the youngest with their first season in 1976. Two have never won Superbowls with the Lions being one of the four never to go and all three teams combining for 2 appearances. 

Reasons for cardinals

1. 10 playoff appearances in 100 seasons 
2. 30 winning seasons in 100 years
3. 9 double digit winning seasons compared to 27 losing seasons
4. 35 coaches that average 2.86 seasons each
5. They come in at third in number of first overall picks with five

-The cardinals have rarely been a good NFL team for being one of the two oldest teams which formed in 1920. The fact that a team former 26 years later has 22 more wins than you is sad and that you rank tenth on all time wins yet have 96 more all time losses than the second most losingest NFL team is sad. The three other teams that formed in the twenties rank much higher in all these respective categories and are some of the most storied NFL franchises in the league and there is no reason the Cardinals shouldn't be also.

Reasons for Buccs

1. They are the least winningest team in nfl history with a 38.5 win percentage
2. They have finished last in their division 21 times and first only 6 times 
3. They have only 2 seasons with plus 100 or more point differential and have had 14 with a minus 100
4. They hold the record for lowest point differential in nfl history keeping in mind it was a 14 game season with -287 and another season with -234 which is a top 15 finisher
5. They are one of the few teams to go undefeated in the modern NFL
6. In 44 years they have had 10 playoff births but keep in mind they have had two playoff droughts with a 14 and 11 season gap between playoff births 
7. They have seen only 2 seasons where there offense and defense were above average in points and only 5 times with yardage.

- I don't want to make this list go on for two long but this team is clearly not a happy one. They have won a Superbowl once but I believe that was a fluke as they went 6-10 the next year. They have one of the worst runs in nfl history famously going 0-26 starting out their franchise. Though it was the beginning of their franchise I do believe that this was just a taste of the sadness that would start for the next 44 years.

Reasons for the Lions
1. Barry Sanders
2. Calvin Johnson
3. 0-16 season
4.  In 90 years only 6 division titles
5. Barry Sanders
6. Barry Sanders

- I believe this team is extremely underrated as a franchise but gets a lot of hate for wasting Barry Sanders career and to a lesser extent Megatron's. Their 0-16 season doesn't help my case but I'm sticking with it.


In my opinion by far the two worst are the Cardinals and Buccs but you can decide which one takes the crown. Why didn't I address the browns? Because I feel like they enjoyed a lot of success in the Jim brown era and have had recent troubles in respective to their entire NFL timeline. Honorable mentions would go to them and the Bengals in my opinion because yeah they are the worst run franchise for the better part of two decades without much competition. As for the Bengals, they are one of the more irrelevant teams in nfl history in my opinion along with the Buccs they are the two most forgettable. I defenintly am not an expert but I tried to eliminate bias and use facts, to be clear I am a bills and rams fan who is more emotional about college ball and don't have much to begin with. It would be cool to see your opinions on this topic and what you think about these three teams.",nfl,RobotoDog,43,2019-11-14

353,Why Lamar should be mvp (hear me out),"The opening: Lamar Jackson should be considered the most valuable player to his team in the league. Last year joe flacco, with the best defense in the league, got a record of 5-5. This not only shows that joe flacco was bad, but the ravens offense was so bad that it couldn’t win even with the best defense in the league. Lamar stepped up and led them to the playoffs. Since then Lamar has improved his passing ability to parallel those of Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers.

Question: shouldn’t Russell Wilson be mvp instead of Lamar? After all, he has more yards per game, better td to int ratio, and the rest of the team is ass.

Rebuttal: I will address all these arguments one by one. 
1) ravens offense is oriented around running the ball. In their last 3 games where they have seemed to find their stride and own identity by defeating Seattle and New England, they have passed only 40.72% of plays. For comparison, Seattle passed 54.59% of plays. This leads to the ravens having much longer extended drives and less drives overall in a game. This accounts for the less total yardage as ravens have many less total drives than Seattle.
2) Lamar is a very good scorer. Ravens are 1st in points per drive which is a very good measure of how efficient a quarterback is. Although he’s a good scorer, greg roman has made the ravens offense move slowly down the field utilizing tight ends and run plays. This leads to Mark Ingram scoring many tds as he has 8 compared to the 4 of Chris Carson. An argument can be made that mark Ingram is a point sponge. Russell Wilson scores many tds as he has a much longer red zone due to his passing ability. However, this doesn’t make Russell Wilson a better scorer, it just makes him a faster one. Compared to the ravens 3.08 pts per drive the seahawks only have 2.27
3) Last year, the ravens had the best defense undoubtedly with players such as Mosley and Za'darius smith stacking their roster. This year, the ravens have been average at best. They gave up 40 points to the browns in a blow out loss. Seahawks have a good run defense with players such as Jadeveon Clowney and Bobby Wagner but they still got run over by Lamar. The ravens run attack is only as good as it is because of Lamar's explosiveness and Greg romans ability to utilize him. Take Lamar away and put in joe flacco and their back to one of the worst offenses in the league as they have no identity. No qb can create plays like Lamar does. Russell Wilson is also very good but when you look at his games, it is plays created by Tyler Lockett. Many of his passes are nearly uncatchable and last second but Tyler Lockett manages to do something. The Seahawks most dangerous aspect is their ability to extend plays but I would argue that Patrick mahomes could easily replace Russell in that category making the same passes. Deshaun Watson even can roll and evade defenses just as well as Russell. The ability to extend plays is created by Tyler Lockett's ability to lose defenders even after a route, not Russell Wilson’s throwing ability. Russell Wilson however cannot break down defenses and confuse their whole defense through having multiple ways to make a play like with Lamar.",nfl,nc410,10,2019-11-14

17,Which players didn't make sense to be drafted as high as they were?,"I'm not necessarily talking about busts here. Ryan Leaf was a bust, but he had the college resume to be drafted high in the first. 

I'll go with a Titans player, for example. Jake Locker was drafted eighth overall in 2011. I actually liked him as a Titan overall, much like Mariota he was a good guy who showed flashes of brilliance only to not get over the hump unfortunately. 

He was the second QB taken in the draft, the first of course being Cam Newton. The thing is, he never looked ""1st round impressive"" as a starter in Washington. He was a career 53.9% completion percent passer. Never tossed for over 3k yards. Averaged 6.7 Y/A career. Tossed only 21 TD's in his *best* season at WA. 

So why did he get drafted so high? It's certainly true that the Titans were desperate and knew there was no way they'd get Cam so maybe they saw Locker as the next best alternative. It was a very shallow QB class, after all (Blaine Gabbert went two picks behind Locker among other selections like Ryan Mallet). 

My biggest issue is that we may have been better served saving Locker for at least the second round, because he had later round talent with a later round resume.

78,How to stop Lamar Jackson (Sarcastic Rant filled with bottled up salt),"I don't know if anyone has thought of this anymore, but I have this super original idea on how to EXPOSE the Ravens offense.

Yes, I'm saying expose as if once you beat a team, other teams can just copy what you did against them and they will never win a game again, because that's how football works. It's not like teams can counteradjust or anything.

(Reminds me of back in this off-season when the Colts supposedly EXPOSED Mahomes or the classic, ""defenses now have tape on Mahomes"" as if Mahomes is some kind of fucking puzzle and not a human being capable of improving and counteradjusting. To those who made this shitty take, how much did that tape help those defenses EXPOSE Mahomes? Fuck this buzzword. Fuck it to the infinity. Can we agree as a community to never use the word expose again? Please?)

So my super original never before heard idea is for a team to stack the box and contain their QB in the pocket and force him to throw.

The only mystery is why teams haven't just copied this idea to beat the Ravens. This must mean I'm smarter than players, defensive coordinaters, and NFL teams in general.

81,[LichtGate Update] I can tell you with 100% certainty that Jameis1of1 is NOT Jason Licht,"Hey all, 

I spoke to a prominent member of the Tampa sports media this morning. S/he called LichtGate ""idiotic"" and was quick to debunk the theory because s/he has Jason Licht's phone number and noted that the numbers do not match. 

This leads me to the inevitable conclusion that Jameis1of1 is in fact /u/aedeos

84,Jersey sizing??,"Hi, so I fit snugly into a youth size L jersey, which means XL is ideal for me, but there are certain jerseys that are available in adult sizes, anyone happen to know what size of the Men’s limited jerseys would fit ideally to those? I am only 5’10 and I am quite skinny",nfl,arbyfig,10,2019-10-30
85,An alternative possible explanation for Jameis1of1 not being Jason Licht,"I will start off by saying, the phone number I can't explain. If it's a coincidence it's a hell of a coincidence. But let's assume it's a coincidence.

Now, part of the question is why would someone be so completely obsessed with Jameis Winston? Whoever this person is, they have 22.3K times and have written a 400 page book about Jameis. That's absurd and honestly a little sad. It would make a lot of sense for this person to have a monetary investment in Jameis. This could be Jason Licht, whose high paying job is tied to Jameis, or, as other people have pointed out...

The username Jameis1of1 is apparently well known in the football card world for having a ton of Winston cards and also being crazy. Here is a page that goes into this:

https://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/brad-metcalf/internet/brad-metcalf-chrome-cards-llc-sports-card-scammer-in-chesapeake-virginia-1320977

If Winston eventually busts out of the league, these cards would become worth a lot less and this person would be out a lot of money. So they have an investment in Winston's future. It is technically possible that the GM knew about this crazy card person in 2017 and started a twitter account using their pseudonym back in January 2017. That'd be some crazy foresight, and I think it's more likely they're the same person.

Another question is, why remain anonymous? This person is very not interested in showing their face. It would make a lot of sense 
if this was Jason Licht, the GM. So if they're not Jason Licht, why would they care so much? Well, this football card person is apparently a woman named Canada from Holly. This would not be the first time that a woman pretended to be a man for sports commentary and worked to keep it secret. 

https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/ryan-schultz-sports-writer-baseball-teen-becca-12348336.php

Ryan Schultz was actually started by a teenage girl who ""wanted to be a sportswriter and figured the only way to get noticed was to act like a ""stereotypical guy."" Possibly this person had similar reasoning - wanting to pretend to be a man to be taken more seriously. The interviews would just be done with a voice changer, and to me the voice does not sound exactly like Jason Licht. 


Finally, one piece of evidence - Jason's Licht's father passed away on 10/3 and the funeral was held at 2 PM:

https://journalstar.com/lifestyles/announcements/obituaries/ronald-lloyd-licht/article_2d7906db-accd-5ecf-8de0-616def6681e7.html

Jason attended his dad's funeral. Jameis1of1 tweeted a whole heck of a lot on that day, and according to this tweet:

https://twitter.com/jameis1of1/status/1179769848425000960

was on sports radio at 1:30 CST for an interview. So either Jason Licht is a shitty person who did a radio interview directly before his dad's funeral, or it's someone else. 

For me personally, it makes more sense for it to be a somewhat deranged fan who has this investment than a GM. The person is just too nuts and it's too much of a time investment over a period of 3 years.",nfl,uhhhhmmmm,45,2019-10-30
87,Help us out!,"Hey everyone, 

Reposting this from yesterday after some people told me it wasn’t appropriate on trade deadline day. Sorry again.

I’d like to talk to you about a program I’ve been developing with a friend for the past year or so. Using tons of our own research, countless regression tests, and over 3000 tests, weve built an analytical model that predicts NFL games, spreads, and over/unders with an astounding accuracy (I’d love to say exactly how much, but were still working on a final figure). All I’ll say is, were more accurate than a lot of the trusted names in sports picks. 

All that being said, were about a month away from some external funding which will put us in a position to begin rolling out the platform. In the meantime, our marketing team could really use your help in filling out a brief interest survey. The answers are completely anonymous, and they would really help us get an idea of what our typical customer would look like in the future. Even if you think our model is total bullshit, your opinion will help us out too! 

The link to the survey is below:

Winner||Loser|Comments
-|-|-|-
[](/SF) 49ers | over | [](/ARI) Cardinals | I said last week that the 49ers need to win against another legit team, and boy did they do just that. San Fran is scary good (Halloween pun) right now, and even in this division matchup I can't see Arizona holding a candle to them.
[](/HOU) Texans | over | [](/JAX) Jaguars | Man, I feel terrible about Watt being out with his pec injury. But the offense is doing so well that the team will still be able to win without him.
[](/BUF) Bills | over | [](/WAS) Redskins | Bills need to work on that run defense, but they're still strong enough to beat a terrible Redskins team.
[](/NYJ) Jets | over | [](/MIA) Dolphins | What the hell is this game? Howard on IR, Talib in the mix now. Darnold probably still seeing ghosts, and Adams stirring in some drama. There's more action off the field than on it!
[](/PHI) Eagles | over | [](/CHI) Bears | So the Bears are still on the Trubisky train, even though Daniel brought them wins. Philly didn't get any love before the trade deadline, but I still think they're the better team in this matchup.
[](/IND) Colts | over | [](/PIT) Steelers | Pittsburgh beat the Dolphins, good for them. I don't think the surprisingly dominant Colts are going to be as simple. But they have Heinz Field helping them out, so we'll see.
[](/CAR) Panthers | over | [](/TEN) Titans | Panthers got smacked in the mouth hard last week. I think they'll bounce back with a hard fought win against a Titans team doing some decent things with Tannehill behind center.
[](/OAK) Raiders | over | [](/DET) Lions | Brandon Marshall is still with the Silver and Black, which is great news for them. This will be another close one with Oakland winning at home.
[](/SEA) Seahawks | over | [](/TB) Buccaneers | Seahawks are showing great strides to nabbing a playoff spot, while the Bucs don't know what to make of their QB at this time. Seattle at home should be a comfortable pick this week.
[](/DEN) Broncos | over | [](/CLE) Browns | Two more teams that have more drama off the field than on it. Both teams are pretty terrible right now, but I'm flipping a coin and saying Denver will be less terrible.
[](/GB) Packers | over | [](/LAC) Chargers | Packers are right up there with the Saints and 49ers as dominant forces in the NFC. They have a tough game against the Chargers, as Rivers is battling to bring his team into playoff contention. Green Bay will continue to roll this week in what could be a close game.
[](/NE) Patriots | over | [](/BAL) Ravens | This should be an amazing matchup. All season long, people have been saying that New England is undefeated due to their easy schedule, crappy division, and so on. Well, Baltimore is no slouch, so this is an excellent game to see how good the Patriots are.
[](/DAL) Cowboys | over | [](/NYG) Giants | I think Jones will be a great QB, given more time. But even with Barkley helping him out, they can't account for defensive struggles. Hopefully, the addition of Leonard Williams will help with that. Cowboys will dominate this game, though.

**Byes:** [](/ATL) Falcons, [](/CIN) Bengals, [](/LAR) Rams, [](/NO) Saints

98,"NFL ""Heal Points"" Rankings","**History**

I grew up in the great state of Maine, and our high school athletics organization, the Maine Principal's Association, uses a ranking system for the postseason that I've long been a fan of: ***Heal Points.***

[Heal Points were developed in the 1960s by  Durwood Heal](https://www.penbaypilot.com/article/look-how-heal-point-system-works/35338), the Principal of Schenk High School in East Millinocket, to encourage competition between schools of different sizes that are close to each other geographically.  Maine is a large and mostly rural state, and like most states, our High Schools are divided into different classes of competition.  In Maine, those are classes AA through D.

However, some programs, like Class AA Bangor, have very few fellow schools of their Class near them.  In fact, in Bangor's 8-team ""AA North"" basketball division, their nearest opponent, Lewiston, is a 90-minute drive away, and the rest of their division opponents are all more than a 2 hours' drive.

While in most sports, you play through your division at least twice (home and away), to fill out the rest of the schedule, games against other teams that are close geographically but possibly in a different class are added to the schedule.  This helps save on travel costs for schools like Bangor.  If you're a Class B school with 500 students, playing against a high school like Bangor with an enrollment over 1,000 students doesn't seem like an inviting proposition.  That's where Heal Points come in and try to sweeten the pot.  

The goal of Heal Points is to award points based on the strength of opponents you've defeated, not how many you've defeated.  Beating an 0-10 team will net you literally nothing in Heal Points because that team has shown that literally everyone beats them.  Beating a 1-9 team will net you a little, but not a lot.  You get the picture.

Heal Points initially assign every victory against a Class AA team 45 points, Class A 40 points, Class B 35 points, etc.   The total points based on victories are added up and divided by the number of games in the team's schedule, and that results in a team's *Preliminary Index*.

So imagine your team played ten games.  It went 6-4.   You only get points for victories so the four losses result in 0 points.  The six wins came against 1 Class A school, 4 Class B schools, and 1 Class C school.  That team's Preliminary Index would be calculated as: (40+35+35+35+35+30)/10 = *21 Points*.

But we're not done!  We then repeat the process - but instead of using the 45/40/35 values for wins against teams, we use the defeated team's Preliminary Index (the value we just calculated) to determine the value of a win.  This time we get more accurate results!

What results from that process is called the *Tournament Index*, and it is used to determine playoff eligibility and seeding at the end of a season.  So imagine the teams we beat had PI values of 26, 21, 8, 0, 10, and 5.   You still get 0 points for losses, so your TI would be (26+21+8+0+10+5)=50 points.

Heal Points have been in use in Maine for over 50 years (ironically, Football is the only sport they aren't used in), and there are no signs of them going away any time soon.  As you might have guessed, I love them.

**Applying Heal Points to the NFL**

I have long made a hobby of ranking teams.  While I believe other ranking systems are far better at producing *predictive* rankings like [538's ELO Rankings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/), I think that a variation of Heal Points is the fairest way to seed teams for postseason eligibility or just determine what sort of ranking a team has *earned* for the season.

*Side note: I'm not advocating for any change in the NFL's playoff eligibility and seeding system, I think it is the best of all professional sports and produces must-watch games for all of January.  College football, however...*

To apply heal points to the NFL, I've made a few changes:

**First**, losses don't result in a 0; they result in negative points.  That way losing to the Saints and the Dolphins are not treated the same - that doesn't make any sense, and I think Maine's Heal Points could use that alteration as well.

**Second**, there are no ""base"" values of 45, 40, 35, etc. because each team in the NFL is in the same class of opposition.  So when calculating our initial Preliminary Index, every victory is treated the same.

**Third**, Instead of stopping with the Tournamnet Index, we take the Tournament Index values, treat them as the Preliminary Index, and run through the process a third(!) time to get even more accurate rankings.  And then...we run through the process a fourth(!!) time using those results.  And so on and so on for **ONE-HUNDRED TIMES (OMGWOWOWOW)**.  As this recursive process happens and you look at the rating for the teams change each cycle, you start to see each team's rating approach a single value called a limit for the math-nerds out there).  Every time you run the process, the change is smaller and smaller from the cycle before, and each team's rating gets a little bit more accurate as it approaches the limit.

**Fourth**, the ratings are *normalized*.  That is, they are put on a Bell Curve and assigned a percentile value of 0-100.  This helps everyone understand the rankings better, as you're not dealing with arbitrary numbers.

**An Example**

So say your team is playing the Saints, a team roughly at 98 on the 0-100 scale.  Spoiler Alert, right now, the Saints have the most Heal Points.  If your team wins, they will get 98 points for that game, very nice!!

But what if your team loses to the Saints?  They will only lose 2 points!  Wait, why not 98, you ask?  Because losing to the Saints doesn't say much except that you didn't beat the best team in the league.  Your team played somewhere in the range of 2nd to 32nd best in the league, that's all that game tells us, and so you're penalized, but not that much.

Now, what if you play the Dolphins?  No surprise here, they have the lowest amount of Heal Points at 3.  If you win, you get 3 points.  Whoa, atta boy!  You're not horrible, so have a few points!

But if you lose?  Oh man, you lose 97 points.  You suck man.  You lost to the Dolphins of all teams and the Heal Points are gonna make you feel it in your bones.

It doesn't matter if it happened in Week 1 or Week 17.  The values are recalculated for each week every week.  In fact, every time any game is played, every team's rating shifts slightly, because the results of that game have a domino effect that spreads through every game that's been played so far.

**Ties**And just because I know someone's going to ask, ties are handled pretty simply.  You take the team you played, subtract 50 points from their rating, and that's your game score.

So if you tie the Saints, you will get (98-50)=48 points for the game.  It's roughly equivalent to beating the Bears!

If you tie the Dolphins, you will get (3-50)=-47 points for the game (that is, you'll *lose* 47 points).  That is roughly equivalent to losing to the Jaguars!  Don't tie the Dolphins, it's bad!

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

The Patriots are almost too easy to analyze - but their #10 ranking seems about right given that 5 of their 8 victories have come against teams in the bottom 5.  The best team they've beaten is ranked 18th.  Remember, these rankings are not meant to be predictive, but rather what a team has *earned*.  And even Patriots fans (like myself) can agree that the Pats haven't faced any solid opposition this year.

The **Buffalo Bills** are much more fun to analyze.  5-2 and ranked 18th at 42% (below average)!  Now why?  Look at their shedule:

&amp;#x200B;

|Opponent|Rank|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jets |29th|W|
|Giants |28th|W|
|Bengals |30th|W|
|Patriots|10th|L|
|Titans |24th|W|
|Dolphins |32nd|W|
|Eagles |23rd|L|

Like the Patriots, the Bills have beat up on the worst of the worst in the league, *unlike* the Patriots, they have lost to their mid-tier opposition in the Pats and Eagles.  Remember, losing to bad teams really hurts you.

Ok last analysis, **Oakland Raiders**, 3-4, coming in at 12th and an impressive 70th percentile

&amp;#x200B;

|Opponent|Rank|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Broncos|25th|W|
|Chiefs|4th|L|
|Vikings|11th|L|
|Colts|8th|W|
|Bears|17th|W|
|Packers|3rd|L|
|Texans|5th|L|

The Raiders have faced a brutal schedule, with their only cupcake being the Broncos who they beat.  In addition to that, they beat a mid-tier team in the Bears and a playoff-type team in the Colts, while losing to all 3 of their top-5 opponents.  The Heal Points rightfully place them at 12 based on who they've beaten and who they've lost to.  Even though they're 3-4, they've clearly shown much better results against quality opposition than the Bills.

**Wrap Up**

Ok that's it - if people are at all interested in these rankings, I'll post a weekly update and maybe dive deeper into the process of creating them.  It's hard because I think like a programmer and I know I'm not the best at explaining my algorithms, but I love doing these and have done them for College Football, Basketball, and Hockey in the past because I think they do a great job of showing how well a team has performed.

127,Who was more important to the Pats' success in the last decade or so - Gronk or Edelman?,"No doubt, Gronk was a very important weapon at Brady's disposal with his ability to not only catch but block as well but the team also tended to struggle without Edelman, who has become a huge piece to the offensive puzzle over the last several years, making big time catches.  Who would you say was more important?",nfl,drinkyafkingmilk,18,2019-10-30
130,After Pete Carroll hired John Schneider to be his GM they churned the Seahawks roster to the point that they made 502 transactions from 2010 through November 2011. Relying on picks is only part of the process,"They had significantly less draft capital than the Dolphins have now acquired for the next two years. Only 4 players on the roster when they arrived were there for the 2013 Superbowl and one of them was a punter. 

Pay attention Dolphins. There are pieces to be found everywhere and of course you still have to hit on your picks.

Draft picks are like buying lottery tickets, nothing is guaranteed so unless you can get a lot of them it’s not really worth it. He REALLY wants to be a life long bengal and to most fans he is the only thing to like about the Bengals. Bad teams shouldn’t just forfeit good players, how come no one came after the Cardinals for keeping Fitz all these years?

\- He became the youngest player since 1952 to lead the league in receiving yards, despite missing the first two games of the season due to a suspension 

 [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec\_yds\_year\_by\_year.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_year_by_year.htm)  

\- He recorded 774 receiving yards between weeks 10 and 13, the most ever in a four game stretch (He also holds records for most in a two and three game stretch)

 [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GordJo02/gamelog/2013/](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GordJo02/gamelog/2013/)  

\-  All of this came from quarterbacks Jason Campbell and Brandon Weeden, who combined for a 1-12 record and had respective QBRs of 41.4 and 34.3 that season. (Hoyer also played but suffered a season ending injury early on in Gordon's first game back)

While Ticketmaster and the National Football League continue to force consumers into mobile-only ticketing options as a matter of course, there remains one team where fans are allowed the choice for a ticket that isn’t locked to their phone: the Buffalo Bills. When asked why, a team official commented that the team “realize\[es\] there may be a customer that does not have a smartphone.” That recognition of one of the basic facts surrounding the difficulties in mobile ticketing has drawn praise from the United States Minority Ticketing Group (USMTG) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). 

The mobile ticket entry system has been recognized as rife with problems as it has been forced on consumers in recent years. Keri Russell spoke to News 5 Cleveland after being denied entry to the first Cleveland Browns preseason game of the season.

331,Julian Edelman is genuinely one of the best wide receivers in the NFL,"Everyone sort of writes him off as a total beneficiary of Belichick and Brady, and he is sort of dismissed for being small and not a great athlete.

Obviously he's not on the level of super athletes like Julio, Larry Fitzgerald, Tyreek Hill, etc

However Julian Edelman absolutely has elite hands, the dude can fucking catch anything, and he even has one of the greatest catches in Superbowl history. On top of that he's just clutch and reliable. There's a reason Belichick has kept him in the core squad all these years. Those are the players he tends to stick with. 

Obviously he's not a super athlete like some of the other receivers in the NFL, but the dude has great field awareness and knows how to do his job. He runs the plays exactly how you need him to and he catches damn near everything. Plus he can block. As we all know, Belichick loves WRs and TEs who can block, for good reason. Multidimensional players are the key to having a versatile offense that can change playstyles depending on the opponent. That be Edelman.",nfl,YakDongOHoolihan,107,2019-10-30

That came with the addition of Joe Brady, who was an offensive assistant for the Saints in 2017 and 2018. 

Given the fact that the Saints offense seems like an amazing tree to draw from, especially after we've seen what they were able to do without Brees, and the fact that he was able to elevate Burrow from being basically just another guy to #1 overall pick candidate, you gotta imagine he's gotten a lot of eyes.

- [](/MIA)MIA loss OR  
- [](/NE)NE win OR  
- [](/MIA)MIA tie + [](/NE)NE tie

***Team Control***


The seed that a team controls is the **worst** seed that team could get if they win out.  These are often mutually exclusive due to the fact that it is impossible for teams that play each other in future weeks to both win out (for example, KC, LAC, and OAK all control the AFC West because one team winning out means that they will have victories over the the other two).

***Notes on this week***

- Because MIA can be eliminated with a NE win alone, if MIA defeats NYJ and NE wins this week, both teams will be eliminated from their division race in week 9.  Should this occur, it will be the earliest 2 teams from the same division have been knocked out of the playoff since 2007...when a week 9 NE victory knocked both MIA &amp; NYJ out of the division race.

- Should both NYJ &amp; MIA be eliminated this week, then we won't have any more scenarios of any kind until week 11 (h/t [Kyle Standerfer](https://twitter.com/KyleStanderfer/status/1189138777689620481)).  This is due to the fact that the elimination would require BAL to lose to NE this week, and if BAL loses, then CIN cannot be eliminated from the AFC North race even with a loss to BAL in week 10.

- Both [](/GB)[GB](https://playoffpredictors.com/Football/CustomLeague/SchedulePicker/0e700630-e7fc-43db-92ea-9e71507c57c9/?L=EwRmoyzUT9qwnesVUkkBmdnwHSoqrInnowxmLKHELVbUuauXkIGMPEV498aLrSIksXQtzAAGOTKA&amp;c=cgm:1|tnptlw:true) &amp; [](/NO)[NO](https://playoffpredictors.com/Football/CustomLeague/SchedulePicker/0e700630-e7fc-43db-92ea-9e71507c57c9/?L=EwRmoyzdtiR0Y2y4PKaBmZ9MHQqrEJp5FSZHrpYwqlbP4as316TVeWfkwS3IRgb9KY6vDAAGOTKA&amp;c=cgm:1|tnptlw:true) only control the 2 seed.  This is due to the fact that if both teams end up finishing at 15-1, the tiebreaker will fall to Strength of Victory, which is nowhere near clinched for either team.

- [](/PIT)[PIT](https://playoffpredictors.com/Football/CustomLeague/SchedulePicker/0e700630-e7fc-43db-92ea-9e71507c57c9/?L=EwRmoyzUT9z2reKmMrUBmOMYILTFi7EQGVL5Eqa3KqqLkb43NZ54ZHsk8+rOgRYdguWiwpDeSAAyL5QA&amp;c=cgm:1|tnptlw:true) and [](/LAR)[LAR](https://playoffpredictors.com/Football/CustomLeague/SchedulePicker/0e700630-e7fc-43db-92ea-9e71507c57c9/?L=EwRmoyzUR9zQnOiVOQ1IDMLEKHLTrb6qSxoEHmHwMwXXPxVpNWmf2zcUls9IcM4YMXVg1ogADPNlA&amp;c=cgm:1|tnptlw:true) both effectively control their own destiny.  It requires a very specific setup to keep either out of the playoffs should they win out.  For LAR, the only way they miss is if they end up in a 3-way wildcard tie with NO &amp; MIN.  Because MIN didn't play either of them, the head-to-head between LAR &amp; NO becomes irrelevant, since there is no sweep.  NO would get the 5 seed on common games, and then MIN can get the 6 seed on Strength of Victory.  For PIT, it actually requires multiple ties to get a 3-way tie at 12-4 that PIT won't win on conference record.

470,"Odd question about screen passes, tosses, and trick plays.","So I was thinking about this at work today, and it's kind of difficult to explain but I'll do my best.

So in recent years the little shovel pass on end arounds and stuff has become really popular.  It goes on the stat sheet as a pass which makes sense. That got me thinking about tosses. Well tosses are laterals so that's what distinguishes them from a pass or a run. That makes sense. Then I started thinking about screen passes. What about WR screens that are thrown backwards? Do they go down on the stats as a pass attempt or is it a run? I mean obviously it's a ""pass"" but how is that different then a toss? Obviously I know how they're different schematicly and visually but I'm thinking more in line with how they're recorded as stats.

Another thing kind of inline with this, how are trick plays that are WR screens into pass plays recorded? Do the WR get a reception? Does it count as a passing attempt for the QB who throws the screen? What if it's incomplete and a fumble. Is it still a pass attempt or is it classified as a fumble for the QB?

I'm sorry if this is confusing, I just don't know how to word it very well which in turn makes it difficult to look up.

37,I believe its time to seriously consider a new NFL commissioner.,"First off, I'll get it out of the way...

Yes, I'm a Lions fan. Yes I'm extremely bitter over this latest loss.

Why does no one seem to hold Goodell responsible for the terrible officiating and lack of consequences/response to recent outcries? This is getting ridiculous. Not only are fans all over the place saying that this is the worst year for officiating, but sports writers, talk shows, and even people who don't normally watch football are saying it too. 

The calls seem to happen most when deciding key moments in a game. Whether it's a pass interference call when there's no contact, unnecessary roughness on a routine tackle, or illegal hands to the face when hands are on shoulder pads...these calls seem to be happening more and more.

I've heard rumblings of conspiracy theories about how it's to keep games interesting/close, to protect certain teams' records, or even just to generate buzz and get people talking. Personally, if I had to pick one, itd be that it gives more chances for the offense to make explosive plays which generates more highlights. 

Regardless, its time to hold referees accountable for mistakes. I'm not unreasonable; everyone makes mistakes. But maybe they need a system in place where if a ref makes more than X amount of ""bad calls"" that are reviewed by peers or a committee or whatnot, then they get either penalized by not being allowed to officiate playoff games (bonus money for them if I remember correctly), get demoted to chain gang or something like that , or even fined. Even if they just choose not to renew their contract for the next season and tell them it's due to their large amount of poor calls, it'd go a long way to fix things.

It got so bad tonight, that even Booger McFarland, commentator on MNF was getting vocal about it. But you could hear that Joe Tessitore and John Parry were quick to support the refs, making excuses and saying that the calls were ""questionable"". They even very clearly quickly shut off Booger's mic after the final play so he couldn't comment on how the game shouldn't have ended how it did and how the refs were exceeding terrible tonight. 

All in all, I think that the NFL needs a new person in charge. Someone who isn't afraid to embrace the modern era, hold officials accountable for mistakes, and do more than just lord over the era of babying players and fining players for what seems to be every hit, comment, and penalty.

40,Aaron Rodgers finally broke the curse of the cherrypicked stat. Going into tonight he was 0-38 when trailing against a team in the 4th quarter that had a winning record going into the game. After tonight he is 1-38.,"Now I know this doesnt feel like much since the refs seemingly handed GB the win. I just thought I would point it out since this stat gets brought up a couple times a year.

Now, for clarification this stat doesnt apply to 4th quarter comebacks against teams that finish the season with a winning record. For example, the 17 point comeback vs the bears last year doesnt count because the bears were 0-0 at the time even though they finished 12-4. For this stat it only counts if the opponent had a winning record at the time the game was played.",nfl,ltbr55,6,2019-10-15
41,I'm calling for officiating change within the NFL,"I'm formally calling upon the owners of the NFL to raise concerns about the current form of officiating in the NFL.

No matter what team you rooted for tonight, I and many others across board bases believe the officiating done tonight altered the game for the worst collectively. No fan base or fan wishes the league to go in the direction this went in tonight nor do I hope any fan has to experience what has transpired tonight. I believe the only change that be done moving forward will either be a loud outcry from the collective fan base of the NFL or their owners.

But I gotta give him credit for part of this game. He called out the refs for those 3 bogus flags thrown against the Lions. He went after the refs for both hands to face penalties on Trey Flowers. After the first hands to the face, Booger called it like the shit call it was and Joe Parry tried to defend the refs decision by saying you can’t review everything due to subjectivity and my man Booger fires back saying there’s nothing subjective about it. THE TRUTH. 

He then keeps his hotstreak going by breaking down that bad unnecessary roughness call against Walker on Allison, maybe in the most elementary way possible, but he was right. Walker was playing the ball and the refs were far too trigger happy. If anyones to blame, it’s Rodgers for tossing that 50-50 ball. That play gave me flashbacks to Manning trying to get Austin Collie sent home in a hearse.

83,A lifetime marketing exec viewpoint on why botched calls are actually something NFL leadership wants to keep.,"Hear me out. I've studied behavioral science, the psychology of the consumer, and have spent my entire career in consumer marketing.

Some of it was fun. A lot of it was dirty.

Let's talk about botched calls - like the two against Flowers in tonights Lions / Packers game.

I want you to think like an executive. I think I can help you think like one.

First, understand what matters most to the NFL head office. I'll give you a hint; it's not player rights, it's not ticket sales. Hell, it's not even jersey sales.

The NFL craves eyeballs more than anything else. Eyeballs on their product means more advertising (read: most important) dollars. Since we're thinking as executives, consider how many eyeballs were spread across all social channels when Kaep took a knee. As an NFL exec, was this a bad thing?

In advertising technology (ad tech), we measure such things as time spent viewing an ad, clickthrough rates, and a litany of other acronyms which new marketing grads like to spout. But what matters most is eyeballs.

""Fuck your safely obtained cost per thousand views, give me controversy."" is a phrase that got thrown tossed about at one conference I was at a while back. 

Again, with your executive cap on, as an NFL representative: are you - personally as it pertains to your strategic role in the company working to drum up more eyeballs (and advertising dollars) - upset with how things went down tonight?

And how do you feel about all those (correct) comments that fans make about ""it blows my mind that we can see everything instantly in HD but are relying on one old guys fading eyesight and questionable vantage point on the play"" - as an exec, do they matter?

Yes, they matter. For the opposite reasons of what people shout, however.

They matter because more controversy equals more eyeballs. And more eyeballs equals more ad revenue across more channels.

*Oh, you're pissed off at the call(s)?

Start a Reddit thread (or YouTube vid, or podcast, or blog, or Insta, or Tweet) about it. Tell us all about the rage you feel. Please help nurture its virality. In fact, we will support your by having ""independent"" (not true) analysts agreeing with you and even retweeting your anger. Let's build this and use that momentum to create a snowball, an avalanche of a conversation that will certainly lead to absolutely no change in the way we do business, because fuck you, eyeballs.

Bring us all the eyeballs.*

Now, consider a game filled with smart, sensor driven tech. I guarantee you this is the worst case scenario for the NFL - you remove one of the (if not the most) critical human roles from the game and replace it with robots and sensors. Every play is instantly calculated. Every catch review is immediately and instantaneous.

The game becomes surgical. It becomes faster. Less human element and less time for advertising, since there is no time needed for review, and the calls happen right away without impeding game flow. 

Less eyeballs. Less engagement. Less conversation.

In the end, we lose as fans. The emotional rollercoaster which NFL execs place on you - Lions fans - with it's intentional retention of a legacy system which is obviously flawed but generates, perhaps, the greatest amount of conversation (next to frozen feet and Belichik interviews) is actually, physically damaging to your long term health. 

And that's a damn shame. I think I'll blog about it.",nfl,rational_faultline,7,2019-10-15

136,The calls against the Lions tonight were bad and wrong. But if you are angry with the Packers for these calls you are misguided and wrong.,"I'm sure this will be a lightning rod of hate and controversy, but I see a lot of people in many of these threads raging against the Packers for benefiting from the terrible calls against the Lions tonight.  I know most of you understand that the Packers had nothing to do with it, but the sentiment is still strong enough that it seems to warrant talking about.  I want to be clear: the calls were terrible, and being the beneficiary of these calls feels gross.  But some people seem to think this has something to do with the Packers being darlings instead of correctly identifying the problem: the refs are god awful and indiscriminately make horrendous calls.  

After all, don't forget: last week vs the Cowboys the Packers were on the other end of another [Extraordinarily terrible call.] 
(https://twitter.com/CharlesRobinson/status/1180993473257889794)  Fortunately that call didn't end up changing the outcome, but the point still stands. I could go on and bring up plays of the past like the Fail Mary, the Jerry Rice fumble, or any other of the countless travesties of bad calls that changed the outcome of a game but my point is this:  these calls happen to every team.  The blame and hate should be focused squarely on the refs for their ineptitude, and instead of squabbling about how your team got screwed and their team got handed the game by the refs laser focus that rage against the people that deserve it.

  Maybe if enough people complain in the right direction then we can get some real reform and can stop having these rage inducing, table flipping moments that taint the game and make everyone unhappy.  The refs are bad and wrong.  They are badong.  And it's time the NFL did something about it.

TL;DR : Don't hate the player, hate the game.  Demand the NFL does something about this shit officiating so we can all stop pulling our hair out and/or feeling dirty about this cheap garbage that has been happening with alarming regularity lately.",nfl,BadWolf2386,6,2019-10-15

143,Leonard Fournette might be on the verge of a really good season,"At the surface level, he’s third in the league in rushing, which is a nice look. He’s averaging 5.1 yards per carry as well, good for ninth in the NFL overall and third amongst players with at least 100 carries. Even better look.

Digging deeper, Fournette’s average of 3.5 yards after contact per carry leads the NFL by a wide margin for anyone. Dalvin Cook is second in the NFL with 2.8 yards per carry (that’s a difference of .7 YACPC [im really good at math]). For reference, if you subtract .7 from Cook’s 2.8 YACPC you drop to Chris Carson at 2.1 YACPC, ranked 15th in the league. So to recap, the gap from best in the league to second in the league is as big as second in the league to 15th in the league. Very nice. 

Goes without saying, Fournette’s average yards before contact per rush is very bad. Ranked 34th out of 41 eligible candidates according to ProFootballReference, and yet he seems to be killing it regardless.

I like the Jags, I’m a big fan of Fournette. Lack of TDs and relatively small sample size notwithstanding, it seems like he’s playing well according to some stats. But it’s bizarre, because the consensus on this sub seems to be that he’s still a borderline bust who is closer to being bad than he is to being good and... I can’t help but agree? I watch Jags games pretty often and I generally leave the game being underwhelmed. Is this fake news, am I missing something, or has he turned a corner?",nfl,gyman122,22,2019-10-15
144,Solution to officiating,"Every year the officiating gets worse and worse it seems. I think I have a solution. First off, I don't know if the league does anything to officials for obvious game altering calls, like the Saints non-PI call last year, in any other professional if your bad at your job you get reprimanded. 

To battle bad officiating I think first the league needs to step in and tell officials to let go of ticky tack calls, I'd rather have non calls than more flags. Of course obvious and egregious penalties still will be flagged. 

Defensive penalties need to not be automatic first downs. An offensive should have to gain 10 yards for a first down. If there defensive holding by a defensive end on 2nd and ten, it should become 2nd and 5. Defensive penalties for the most part should be from the original line of scrimmage, except for penalties such as pass interference, can't have a DB table a receiver 50 years down field and only get a penalty from the OLS. Offenses are rewarded too much for defensive penalties in my opinion, it still needs to be on the offense to run plays and move the ball, and not rely on the defense to commit penalties.",nfl,D3VIANT_J3ST3R,12,2019-10-15

Basically the idea is to post a nomination for what you thought was the worst officiating mistake of the week. Based on the top comments I would then like to make a poll to vote and decide which fanbase actually was the recipient of the worst call of the week. I am currently planing on taking the top 5 comments and using those calls in the poll. I would like to keep this open for 2 days and then create the poll using the responses. If there is a post that seems to be getting a lot of late traction I might include that call as well but still also include the top 5 comments in the thread. That is to minimize the fact that the first posts in a thread are normally the most popular by default. Don't want to not include a really bad offender just because it wasn't posted until later. 

Not a requirement but your nomination will probably get more attention if you include a link to the highlight and not just a description of the call. Please note I am not a mod. So I can't enforce any rules in the thread. Downvote what you disagree with. If you see a call you don't think was bad downvote it. If it was really bad then upvote it.

Pick 3 head coaches you would/wouldn’t want along your side in a 4 v 4 street fight

Pick 3 head coaches you’d choose to fight along side you in a 4 v 4 street fight, and 3 coaches who would be on the bottom of your list.

I’ll start:

1. Adam Gase- Super human cokehead strength. Nothing will harm him. Could get stabbed in the chest and will remain a stable fighter.

2. Brian Flores- Absolute Tank. He will be fighting with a lot of anger and rage due to his disappointing season. Plus Miami residents are known to be great street fighters RIP KIMBO

3. Mike Tomlin- Another fuckin tank. Looks like Apollo Creed anyway, I bet he has a mean left hook. Also I’m sure he use to smack AB around In the locker room

178,We need to stop having such short memories.,"Every time a game goes like this, the comments are always “It’s rigged so the [team I hate] wins” or “the refs have had it out for the [team I love] for years. 

There’s only one constant, and that’s the fact that NFL refereeing sucks. But over the years, every team gets the benefit of some bad calls and loses out due to others. It’s an endless cycle that doesn’t consistently go in any one direction. 

There are way too many of us out here going “But it always seems like...”
No. That’s your emotions talking. 

Yes, last night was a bad game for the officials, but that doesn’t mean that the Packers are always on the refs’ good side. Think “Fail Mary” or Clay Matthews’ roughing the passer. 

Yes, the Lions got fucked, but that doesn’t mean there’s some grand conspiracy to keep the Lions out of the playoffs.

179,"We need to stop calling it ""bad officiating"" and start calling it what it is- rigging games.","It's clear the NFL is pushing refs to make calls the heavily benefit 1 team that's in the league's best interest to win.

181,Time For Something To Change,"First off I do not wish any harm to come to the Refs as it pertains to their physical well being but as professionals most of them should be fired. These errors are egregious, blatant, and down right inexcusable. Once is a mistake, Twice is a coincidence, Three times is a pattern, but EVERY WEEK ACROSS MULTIPLE GAMES!. Now that is a gawd dam conspiracy. The optics of these blatant mistakes calls into question the integrity of the sport. The League brings all of this on themselves. Alberto Riveron believes him and his officials are above reproach.  How the Hell can the NFL try to hold the players accountable for their actions but refuse to take any against the referees. The NFL's job is to protect the shield but they are allowing these officials to chisel away at the enjoyment, integrity and competitive aspect of this sport we all love. These refs are suppose to be the best of the best and top of their profession but if this is their best my gawd I wanna see what their worst is. Replacements were terrible but they had an excuse for being incompetent, the current iteration of refs do not. Some of you may say that their job is hard and I cannot do it correctly and you would probably be right. One thing I do know is that no matter how bad I would be at it I would have job security so there would be no reason for me to get better. You see when the NFL and Alberto Riveron doesn't publicly call out bad officiating the refs no longer have any incentive to try to correct their mistakes in a future setting. This isn't just about last night's game it is about an issue that keeps happening week in and week out. The NFL runs the Crucial Catch to bring attention the cancer but cannot stop the cancer of bad officiating spreading throughout their game. You do not have to be an expert in traffic laws to make an opinion on whether or not someone ran a stop sign. This is just saddening, maddening, and disheartening.",nfl,ToxicMagikarp,0,2019-10-15
182,Why does the NFL not take advantage of modern technology?,"Since we're all fussing about refs today (us Browns fans have been waiting on y'all to catch up to that for years) here's something to talk about.  Something easy.  

Why isn't the NFL taking a lot of responsibility out of the refs hands?  We could eliminate ball spotting errors, inbound vs out of bounds calls, phantom fumbles and more by just putting an RFID chip in each end of the football and at each 10 yard marker.  Same tech they have in the balls for top golf.

Obviously every play should be reviewable.  Every play should also be easy to review, so there isn't a grey area.  Camera tracking RFID is pretty simple.  That means they could have a basically unlimited number of extra angles for review and they wouldn't even have to man them.

There goes your need for line judges too.  You want the NFL to buy in on paid, full time officials?  It's way easier for them to do when they only have to pay for 2-3 to run a game.",nfl,Kraggen,3,2019-10-15

184,Referees aren’t new,They’ve always messed up. They’ve always cost teams games. They’ve always effected the outcome. Why are we acting like this is new or what happened last night was the worst case of that when it isn’t even close? It’s like everyone always says you had chances to win before that you live with what the refs call. I’m just amazed by how many people either watched their first football game last night or are just naturally dramatic. That stuff happens every game with major implications all the time.  Remember when the packers intercepted the Seahawks for a touchdown for the Seahawks that cost them home field advantage in the playoffs? Again every team has their stories it’s not new.,nfl,Oilupto,28,2019-10-15
185,Detroit’s ‘loss’ cost them top spot in their division and sent them to last place. It’s crazy that two bad calls can potentially end your season.,,nfl,DadImHome,64,2019-10-15
190,Serious question for the lawyers in the sub: what would it take to bring a class-action lawsuit against the NFL to force them to officiate consistently?,"This has been a remarkably bad stretch of officiating - a bit like the refs have collectively dropped their balls on the table and shouted ""overturn this, BITCH!"" But it makes no sense to believe that the league couldn't do something about this if they wanted to. I don't believe the refs have that much power.

The reason I started wondering about the viability of a class-action is because of how much money people have invested on the assumption that they'll receive a consistent product. Tickets, subscriptions, etc - all purchased on the assumption that the rules are the same for each team, and that there should be no (or at least minimal) variance in the enforcement of penalties according to the letter of the rules. If this consistency is not guaranteed, you end up with arbitrary outcomes to games. This is not acceptable - it is a failure on the part of the NFL to deliver the product it advertises. In my limited legal understanding, that kind of systemic and sustained failure to deliver the product advertised is what can lead to a CA suit.

When you've got nearing 100% agreement that calls - *major*, game-altering calls - are improperly called on a weekly basis, do the consumers/fans have no recourse? Phantom hands-to-the-face this week - TWICE - Jarvis Landry somehow getting called for a block in the back when our young safety launched himself into Landry's chest... What is going on? Why shouldn't these be overturned?

The NFL, for whatever reason, seems to be refusing any kind of transparency about how these calls are made and sustained - which is extremely suspicious. The best solution, IMO - if, say, an arbiter were to judge that the fans have a right to consistent officiating and the league has failed to deliver that - would be the creation of some kind of third-party officiating oversight body to review calls. Challenges to calls go right to the third party, their deliberations are transparent/broadcasted, they decide the correct call by looking at a rulebook and the available video, and then we move on with the game.

There's just no reason for it to be *this bad,* unless, as I increasingly believe, the league is operating in bad faith or with ulterior motives. In an age with this level of technology, there is simply no reason for obviously incorrect calls to stand - it hurts the players, it hurts the fans, it hurts the game.",nfl,Caulibflower,25,2019-10-15
192,How many teams could the NFL add and still be entertaining?,"I was thinking about bye weeks since the Colts just had theirs and how beneficial it is to teams to have a week off to recover. This led to the thought of what about adding a second bye week to the season? In order to do that I think you would need more teams to fill those gaps so you still have 7-8 games a week.

But in adding teams or games you dilute the product even if only a little bit.

So how many teams could the NFL add and still be as entertaining? 2? 4 more?",nfl,IndyPoker979,12,2019-10-15
194,"Refs should be fined for these horrible calls, or at least allow teams to challenge penalties.","Players can get fined for helmet to helmet contact, equipment violations, not talking to the media, and so on and so forth. 

If we are ok with players being fined the nfl should be ok with also fining refs for bad calls the directly change the outcome of a game. Since the lock out in 2012 officiating has been on a steady decline in it quality. 

Something needs to be done to stop this and some changes need to be made weather it’s fining the refs or allowing teams to challenge penalties.",nfl,bigcat5591,55,2019-10-15
198,The two facemask calls weren't what changed the game.,"I've been looking at the highlights after calming down a little bit and while yes, the two facemasks majorly affected the outcome those were just two of many calls that ultimately caused a team to become fourth in their division instead of first. The two facemasks were definitely the wrong call but I could see the refs calling it, but it seemed that whenever there was a sketchy call it went GB's way. On the same play as the 2nd facemask calls there were 10x more blatant fouls against the Packers. Then there was the Kerryon Johnson call that would have made a td necessary for the Packers and that imo was clearly a TD. Then there was that no PI call that was way more blatant than the fouls against Detroit. Not to speak of that horrendous PI call on Detroit when he did not intentionally initiate contact. That's the end of my rant now, it's just so frustrating to see the game you love being ruined by blind, old zebras.",nfl,11tyhundred,22,2019-10-15

201,Fans Unite: Shun the refs!,"Problem: We as fans of professional football need to find a way to make our voices heard about this terrible officiating. We can't boycott the NFL because we love it too much. We can't just boo the refs because fans are expected to act that way. That's just normal behavior. We can't post our opinion on Facebook or Twitter because that's faceless opinions and aren't taken seriously. What can we do?

Proposal: We take a stand. Literally. Any time the refs are calling a penalty, fans at the stadium stand up and turn the other way and make absolutely no noise. Imagine the impact that would have even with even half the stadium. 

We get the word out however we can. Reddit, word of mouth at the stadium...whatever. And not just for one game. It would have to be continuous until more people get involved. 

Intended Result: To just get recognition or a statement from Goodell/NFL that they realize something is wrong. Or until we see a change.

If we believe this will work, then it will work. I love football too much to watch teams lose games because of whatever is going on with the officiating. We need to hold everyone accountable the only way we can. Let me know what you think!",nfl,EnemyFriendEnemy,4,2019-10-15

There should be a whole team of guys up there! We were always told to double check our work. Why are we letting these decisions ride on ONE pair of eyeballs that’s watching 22 grown men grapple at 100mph????? ESPN calls over to the ref for “clarification” every call.

208,Unlimited Challenges With A Twist - Will It Work?,"Rule - Teams have unlimited challenges which they can use after refs have made their decision with or without the use of ""sky judge"".




If a challenge succeeds, we get the call right. NFL has to pay 1 million dollars to a charity nominated by challenging team.



If a challenge fails, opposing team gets awarded 7 points.  




It will accomplish the following - 



1. Challenges will be used by teams only when there is clear video evidence. Hence game will not be slowed down unnecessarily. 




2. NFL will be monetarily incentivized to make sure they get the calls right. Even if the call was wrong initially, NFL product will not suffer as the challenge would result in decision which was arrived at thorough review.",nfl,-Deadzone-,4,2019-10-15
211,[Serious] Does the Controversy Drive Revenue?,"I don’t think the NFL is rigged—but I do have to wonder about this given the sheer volume of outrageous calls made over the past decade or so.

I’m starting to think that the amount of website hits (articles, blogs, etc) that controversial calls garner could be a major factor in the NFL’s failure to implement common sense fixes here. (Also, probably sports talkshows).

232,The outrage over the horrendous calls last night are puzzling to me,"Don't get me wrong: I think the refs need to be called out.

But... Why do NFL fans have such an issue with officiating only in the fourth quarter?

Let me explain with a Steelers example since that's the team I'm most familiar with.

Last year we had this in a game we lost:

https://youtu.be/HRPysNnnbq8

So the lineman is already perfectly situated for the rush when the ball is snapped and Watt is unable to even have a chance to make a play.

...

I bring this up because when an issue like this is brought up that occurs in the 2nd or 3rd quarter the rhetoric is ALWAYS the same: ""Well the game is 60 minutes, don't let one bad call dictate the game. Every team gets bad calls.""

But if it were to happen with 2 minutes left in the game on primetime? OUTRAGE. So ""Don't let bad calls dictate the outcome of the game"" only counts if the call takes place in the first 55 minutes?

And a bonus one: 

https://youtu.be/pVywG4X21lM

This is basically a ~10 point swing of a play where one of the best teams in the NFL gets an automatic touchdown versus a turnover on downs. NFL fans: ""overcome one bad call""

233,Replay review after last night,"Anytime a penalty is reviewed, right now it is only PI but after last night we may see more being added to the list, the refs on the field should not  be the ones reviewing those plays.

238,[Serious] What is your solution to fix reffing?,"Fines? Have fun with the replacement refs. Get better refs? You already have the best refs in the world. Robot refs? Technology isn't there yet.

My idea would be to not show instant replay unless there was a challenge, the 40 second play clock allows us to watch in slow mo and zoomed in, every single part of every single play. You can't do that in every sport otherwise you end up missing live action, but we have ~30 seconds of ""dead space"" between plays and the networks have been cramming in slow mo, zoomed in replays that shows things you can't expect a human to catch.",nfl,WasV3,74,2019-10-15

246,ALL penalties SHOULD be subject for review from a crew of officials watching from the booth that can OVERRULE anything called on the field.,"Each game in the NFL should have a separate officiating crew made up of 2 to 3 individuals watching from a booth replay system with all cameras from the field. This would be the head officiating crew and could overrule the crew on the field AT ANY TIME. Obviously, this would only be used for blown calls like the one we saw last night with the illegal hands to the face. Calls that are so bad (or penalties that are not called) that greatly impact the game. 

With the technology we have and all the cameras floating around the ball, there is no excuse for missing calls like this that decide a game. It's not good for the fans, it's not good for the teams and it's hurting the product. This change has to happen.",nfl,rush0024,29,2019-10-15
251,The officiating has to be looked at,"The NFL officiating has to be looked at. I don't care what anyone says, I have watched long enough to see teams like the Browns and Lions gets horrendous officiating to know something is up.

From a ref openly saying a quarterback is allowed to get hit helmet to helmet with a lead hit, to giving possession of a fumble to the opposing team when the other literally has it in their hand and is walking off with it, to dual hands in the face and blindside blocks that aren't.  Open your eyes.",nfl,panther705,13,2019-10-15
256,US Bank the Bird Graveyard,"When US Bank stadium was being built many people said that it would be a death trap for birds. When it was completed that was proved correct immediately.

But the less talked about fact is that it is killing the bird teams of the NFL as well. Over the last four seasons the Vikings are 8-0 (including preseason) against bird teams inside of this avian slaughterhouse. Outside of their ominous purple bird trap the Vikings are only 3-4 (including pre-season and post-season) against all bird teams they have faced.

Please address,"Hey everyone so obviously there have been some bad calls by the officiating and it’s not only against the Lions, but as a fed up Lions fan I think something needs to be done as a whole. The blown calls are ruining the spirit of the game. This is a call to action to FLOOD the NFL and everyone associated that this activity is UNACCEPTABLE. We can complain all we want but without making sure we are heard there is no point. I am here to encourage everyone to message the NFL and every organization associated our concerns! I suggest messaging them on every platform possible. Copy and paste your message to each social platform and dm them to make sure we are heard. My message to the NFL would be that is in unacceptable and their needs to be something done to create consistency in these calls. My message to the TV networks is that we are sick of watching this happen over and over and that the networks should not accept this. My message to the Lions organization is that they have my support and that they need to raise their voice and be heard, they have the support of the fans. If you are not a Lions fan I encourage you to reach out to your team and ask them to take a stand with the fans of the NFL. Together we are strong! Please take a few minutes of your day to message everyone below on each platform, the more messages the LOUDER our voice. This should be overwhelming for them all.  

Below are links to everyone that needs to hear this message, and if anyone needs to be added please let me know and I will update it. Let’s make this change happen. Share this message however you want.

I guess I prefer the college game because I'm from Alabama and it's just sort of what we grew up with. But I definitely try to keep up with the NFL as well when I can. And what I don't understand are the penalties.

It seems like every fourth or fifth play there's a flag for something ticky-tacky. And I also can't stand spot foul PI calls. I've literally watched the refs alone decide the outcome of 20-25 games in a season. A close football game should never be decided by a pass interference call that places the ball *at the one fucking yard line* or some bullshit hands to the face like Trey Flowers got called for. It's ridiculous. This happens in the college game a little but nowhere near to the extent it does in the NFL. 

If they're professionals, why don't we just let them play? Is there any specific reason why the refs always feel they have to be the key component in deciding a game? I was really excited to have Sundays off this fall so I could keep up with the NFL. After about 5 weeks, it dawned on me that, at times, it's barely even football.

308,A counter explanation for the PI review lack of overturn.,"Many people have been complaining about the lack of overturning PI calls. And I know one belief is that Al Riveron is doing this for ego purposes and to dissuade questioning officials.  

But. I'm not entirely sure that's the only reason. I think the NFL realizes there's a fine line in reviewing subjective calls. For example: One year the NHL had a few missed offsides calls that led to guys getting break aways and scoring. This led to grumbling by fans. So the NHL put in an offside review wherein entry into the zone could be reviewed after stoppage of play to see if it was legal. Fans were OK with this, because they wanted a mechanism for overturning these blatant misses. But it had a consequence. Now, there have been goal overturns where a guy entered the zone before the puck by a fraction of a second early and the team scored a goal after 30 seconds to a minute of zone time (i.e. not after a break away). Needless to say, fans have not liked that aspect, even though it's ""getting it right"". Because fans only ever want egregious things overturned, not plays that take 8 angles and 10 minutes of measuring. But, of course, there's no set definition of that.      

It's entirely possible (and my own personal belief) owners wanted a mechanism in place to prevent another NFC Championship issue so they don't have to deal with that again. Instances where it's so blatantly and absolutely obvious and has an impact to a big game. The NFL however also doesn't want an ""offsides review"" problem, where PI calls are now investigated at every inch and angle, leading to fans grumbling about that (think the catch rules). Not only that, but it opens pandora's box and leads to awkward rule cases where refs have to determine if the ball left the QB's hand (thus is PI and reviewable) or not (thus is illegal contact and _isn't_ reviewable). So, do you extend it, knowing fans will also grumble about more replay?   

So now we have the league dissuading coaches from not challenging plays that are even some level of questionable. To which, it seems to be working to some effect. There was a missed DPI last night, but Patricia did not challenge it. Probably because he knew it wouldn't be overturned.   

Granted, this is conjecture. But it's definitely another reason the league would want these challenges to be scarce, and therefore isn't a ref conspiracy. I lean in this direction, because I believe the NFL would be pressuring Riveron publicly if he had indeed went rogue.",nfl,Iceraptor17,28,2019-10-15

If this were done with a message in alignment with, “We, the customers, fanbase of the NFL, refuse and reject your product, a form of the game of Football, until all future games going forward are called fairly and accurately by the referees, and in accordance with the NFL’s rules....

Something like that. My point is we need to hit them in the wallet. Its really the ONLY way we can force a change. Money is the only thing they will listen to, they could give a damn about us. Thing is, far fetched as it seens- we actually HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS CHANGE. Sorry about that bogus game last night. The Lions got straight robbed, and I am convinced the NFL is rigged.

How this works:  
Each team started with a plot of land. If a team wins a game against a team that currently holds land, the winning team takes all of that land. This map is of where that land has ended up at this point in the season.  

Changes from last week:  
* The Vikings reclaim their homeland from the Eagles.  
* Nope, that's it. Nothing else changed.  

Current Land Leaders (by starting plot count):  
10: Colts  
8: Saints  
4: Raiders, Vikings, Patriots  
2: 49ers  

Games with land at stake (teams with land **bolded**):  
**Vikings** @ Lions  
**Raiders** @ Packers  
Texans @ **Colts**  
**49ers** @ Redskins  
**Saints** @ Bears

Considering the Rams and the Chargers have both been LA teams at some point in their histories and have returned, how did you come to support your team and why? Or did the years of not having a franchise force you to root for another team?",nfl,Aboveground_Plush,67,2019-10-15
409,The problem with NFL officiating no one is discussing - the game itself.,"If you compare the NFL to other pro sports, the impact of officiating is so much more than any of the others. The reason is pretty straight forward and unfortunately inherent to the game.

If you look at a full NFL season (exclude playoffs for now) you have a 16 game season. Each of those games will net you an average of 12 offensive possesions which means on average you have 192 possesions over the course of a season. If you break it down further, the average number of plays in a game is about 75 per team which gives about 1200 plays in a season. The difference between being 10-6 and playoff bound vs 6-10 and watching from home could easily be accounted for in a difference of 5-10 plays. Keep in mind that there was an average of 7 penalties per game in 2018. Many times, those penalties significantly impact those absolutely critical plays and can be the difference in the game. A bad call can be devastating for a team's season.

Now let's compare that to the NBA for example (although any major sport is fine). On average, each team has 100 possesions per game in an 82 game season for 8200 possesions over the course of the season. Bad calls absolutely happen in the NBA with an average of about 40 whistles a game. Even if you account for 50% of those being a bad call, the impact of the call is a significantly less than the NFL. While the foul directly leads to points in the NBA (unlike NFL penalties) this is not as relevant  because there's more opportunity to score in the NBA. Additionally, due to the law of averages, both teams will likely benefit from a similar amount of bad calls that they usually aren't significantly different over the course of a full season. Maybe your team gets screwed the last game of the NBA season because of a bad call, but chances are you benefitted multiple times throughout the season to get you there in the first place.

This is not the case with the NFL, even the number of plays in a full career pales in comparison the the number of plays in an nba season. The refs make a much more significant impact because of the law of averages cannot take as great of an effect.

Looking at playoffs is even worse as the NFL is one game vs 5 or 7 in the other major sports. This is why you see the best teams in the finals or deep playoffs every year in the NBA whereas the NFL always has cinderellas and high playoff turnovers and superbowl hangovers.

While instituting a 3rd party replay booth may be a better option, everyone must accept that the many games, seasons, champions, and even careers often times come down to officiating and luck. 

TLDR: the game of football is flawed and will always have problems with poor officiating simply because of the design of the game and limited possessions compared to other pro sports.",nfl,MIGSguy15,35,2019-10-15

416,A quick look into Russell Wilson's and the Seahawks ability to win and lose close games.,"Since Russell Wilson came into the league in 2012, I've found myself noticing over the years how often it seems like the Seahawks win or lose games by the skin of their teeth. Obviously, every team is involved in close games, but it seems that Seattle is on another level. This is a testament to how challenging of an opponent the Seahawks have been for the past 7+ years, as well as Wilson's ability to make plays, and the defense keeping games close, even post-LOB.

The first six weeks of 2019 have been no different, as the Seahawks have won their five games by a combined 25 points, and their only loss being 6 points. I'm not a data expert or analyst, but I dug into their point differentials during the Wilson-era, and thought it would be fun to share some interesting stats. A quick note - I only looked at regular season games, and ignored the tie with Arizona in 2016.

* Across the 80 games the Seahawks have won with Wilson at QB, the average point differential in those games is **13.6**. Across the 37 games the Seahawks have lost with Wilson at QB, the average point differential is a slim **7.1**. These have made for many close and anxiety-provoking games that I'm sure have ruined many a liver in Seattle. What more does this mean? I have no idea, but it would be interesting to compare this to other teams with QB stability during the same stretch.
* One of the most dominant stretch of games in terms of point differential and scoring for the Seahawks was in Wilson's first season (2012). Over the course of a three-game stretch, they outscored their opponents 150-30. Had just those three games never happened, the Seahawks average point differential in games where they were victorious drops by more than a full point to **12.5**.
* An average point differential of 13.6 during wins may not seem like anything crazy. The Seahawks, on average, have won their games with Wilson at QB by a couple of touchdowns. **However**, when you consider how many of those games have been close, it gets interesting. **45%** of the Seahawks wins under Wilson have been a point differential of below double-digits, and **43%** have been a point differential of 7 points or fewer.
* The point differential during Seahawks losses is bananas. A whopping **89%** of the games that Seattle has lost with Wilson have been a point differential of below double-digits - and **65%** of their losses have been a differential of below 7 points.

So, what does all of this mean? Nothing, really, except for exciting football. It would be interesting to see how other teams compare during this same stretch, specifically those who have had stability at the QB position. I'm sure the team I cheer for has an average point differential during losses of 50 points. If anyone has data on this that's easy to pull or access, I'd love to check it out.",nfl,ranchdressinggospel,38,2019-10-15

467,The Illegal Use of Hands Calls Were Correct Calls,"In the Lions-Packers game, I know the popular opinion is that the refs messed up on the two illegal use of hands calls, but in my opinion, the correct calls were made according to the [NFL rulebook](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2019-nfl-rulebook/#article-3.-illegal-block-by-offensive-player). 

[1st penalty in question](https://youtu.be/gEc4QSG4G-4?t=29)

[2nd penalty in question](https://youtu.be/-J8jHKco9h8?t=129)

Here's the rule:

&gt; ARTICLE 7. ILLEGAL USE OF HANDS BY DEFENSE

&gt; It is a foul if a defensive player thrusts his hands or arms forward above the frame of an opponent to forcibly contact him on the neck, face, or head.

&gt; Note: Contact in close-line play is not a foul, unless it is direct and forcible, or prolonged.

&gt; Penalty: For Illegal Use of Hands by the Defense: Loss of five yards and an automatic first down.

He had his hands on the collar of Bakhtiari and then pushed up into the neck and facemask for a prolonged period of time on both plays.

The commentators argued there was no intent, but intent doesn't matter. I've heard people argue that the contact wasn't forcible, but because it was prolonged contact it doesn't need to be forcible. You can complain about how the rule is written all you want, but IMO that's a foul according to the letter of the law.

The NFL came out with a [video](https://youtu.be/gEc4QSG4G-4?t=29) on this a few years ago and also explained that contact that pins the head back will be illegal hands to the face.",nfl,GridironFootballer,122,2019-10-15
469,"Despite playing only 14 games, the 1948 49ers had maybe the greatest rushing season ever, running for a (still standing) record 3663 yards, and holding second place with 35 rushing TDs (second only to another 14 game team).","As opposed to the 62’ Packers, who hold the record of 36 rushing tds, using Jim Taylor as the true workhorse with Tom Moore as the clear second man, (accounting for 26 tds and 1700 yards on 284 carries) the 49ers had a backfield with a seemingly endless lineup. That season, 6 men carried the ball between 49 and 78 times, with Johnny Strzykalski taking 141 carries. While the leading carrier and rusher, Strzykalski only managed 4 rushing tds (but gained amazingly another 7 through the air). 

HOF FB Joe Perry and QB Frankie Albert would score heavily with 10 and 8 rushing Tds respectively. The four other runners with 50 attempts or more would total up 9 touchdowns, and after that, three more players would score 4 times on the ground. Altogether, they would total up ten scorers. 

Now the yardage individually wont be popping. Strzykalski only had 915 yards (but for a 6.5 ypc which is definitely amazing). And it makes sense. While they ran the ball 603 times, (tying for tenth most in a 14 or less game season) Strzykalski and Perry would be the only guys running more than 5 times a game. But as a whole, there were 10 runners with 100 yards or more, and 6 of them ran for 296 yards or more. And outside of Frankie Albert (running for 5.1 ypc) everyone had a 5.9 ypc or better, with Joe Perry putting up an eye popping 7.3 ypc.

Side note, even dominating the rushing game for that season (running 60 times more than the second place Browns, and 100 times more than half the league) they lead the league in passing touchdowns despite attempting the least passes (only team below 300 attempts) and Albert was fifth in passing yards, and Alyn Beals lead the league with 14 receiving TDs, as well as 5th in receptions.",nfl,Davethemann,15,2019-10-15
470,Official /r/NFL Sidebar Caption Contest,"As you may have noticed, our internal process for picking the top story of the week and highlighting it via the sidebar has been a little slow this season. We thought we would improve the /r/NFL sidebar relevance by opening up a weekly contest where users can submit an image and caption. The mods will select a winner from among the submissions and feature it on the sidebar, crediting the user who created it.

Please note that the winner will be determined by the Moderation Team, and ***not*** by vote count. Relevance to the week that just past will be the most key factor. Another major factor to take into account will be variations in which team is highlighted. There are 32 teams, we don't want to feature the same few teams every week. If we've already done Jags, don't expect your submission about them to get chosen unless every other team has had a turn. Keep in mind the tone that has been used to date, and try to keep within that. Have fun, and keep it *kinda* professional!

Only top level comments will be considered. Including a picture will be appreciated but not required and a lack of a picture will not preclude the submission from being chosen.

476,"The Green Bay Packers are second in the league in beneficiary penalty yards per game, in last place...the Detroit Lions.","[Sauce](https://www.nflpenalties.com/)

Beneficiary yards = negative penalty yards for the other team. 

The Packers get 83.5 beneficiary yards per game. The Detroit Lions are in last with 46.8 yards per game.

Not saying there is truth to the narrative but.....

First in beneficiary yards per game is the Colts. 

If you look at season totals (Colts and Lions have only played 5), the Packers are in first with 501 beneficiary penalty yards. The Lions are in last with 234. 

The Packers are trailed by the Titans in season total beneficiary yards with 456 yards.

477,Game of inches vs. Position to win,"With all the terrible reffing taking place you see a lot of the age old saying ""you shouldn't put yourself in a position where one call loses the game"".



This has always upset me as in the same breath we talk about football being a game decided by inches.  These are professional athletes looking to squeeze out every ounce of optimization to beat an opponent who is doing the same. 


How can you say it's a team's fault partially on a bad call because they didn't put themselves in a better position when games are so close? One play completely can change a game, and that is not anyone's fault... are we to believe every team's expectation is to be up by multiple scores so a bad call doesn't affect it? How is that reasonable? 


Good football is close to the wire and every play matters. One blown call can completely ruin the game, changing the outcome and the loser bears 0 responsibility in my opinion. 


What are your thoughts?",nfl,Mimothy,39,2019-10-15

495,Official /r/NFL Sidebar Caption Contest,"s you may have noticed, our internal process for picking the top story of the week and highlighting it via the sidebar has been a little slow this season. We thought we would improve the /r/NFL sidebar relevance by opening up a weekly contest where users can submit an image and caption. The mods will select a winner from among the submissions and feature it on the sidebar, crediting the user who created it.

Please note that the winner will be determined by **the community**. Relevance to the week that just past will be the most key factor. Another major factor to take into account will be variations in which team is highlighted. There are 32 teams, we don't want to feature the same few teams every week. If we've already done Jags, don't expect your submission about them to get chosen unless every other team has had a turn. Keep in mind the tone that has been used to date, and try to keep within that. Have fun, and keep it kinda professional!

Only top level comments will be considered. Including a picture will be appreciated but not required and a lack of a picture will not preclude the submission from being chosen.

TLDR: defensive pass interference on Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. While lined up for the next play Ref's seem to have communicated with a source off the field and reversed the call resulting in Texan's ball due to an interception.  

Ruling was Kelce was not in the area of the ball. However as the announcers pointed out, at the very least it should have been holding by the Texans on Kelce. 

We have seen Mahomes be very conscious of  flags and how he plays the ball. Seeing a flag Mahomes thinking he has a free play took a dangerous shot to the endzone resulting an interecption.

Just to rag on my own team, the mid 2000s Chargers. I know we ran into the buzzsaw that was New England during some of those years. But there were multiple players on that team that were the best in their position during those years. LT, Merriman, young Phil Rivers. Even lesser known guys like Lorenzo Neal, Igor Olshansky, and Luis Castillo would have walked onto any team in the NFL and started. They did win a little, but nowhere near what they could have.

The one I believe is the right answer is about the final 7 or so years Marvin Lewis was in Cincinnati. Prime AJ, Gio, Eifert, and a QB who could get it to them. The defense had some studs (also shit human beings) like Burfict and Pacman. The Steelers and the Ravens had already had their runs of the AFC North and it seemed like we were on the cusp of a Bengals Age. Instead, those teams never won a playoff game and, as icing on the cake, put on maybe the most embarrassing 4th quarter playoff performance of all time.",nfl,Seeksie,11,2019-09-30

What really made the game so weird though is that both teams were extremely impressive and disappointing at the same time 

**Lions**

Bonkers defensive performance, the way they shut down Mahomes and forced so many fumbles was next level. Plus Matthew Stafford was making moves. 

At the same time, they had some really bad fuck ups that cost them the game, and not to mention the reckless ass hurdles they tried to pull. It was like one minute they looked great, then all of a sudden we get some dolphin shit. They also just seemed to have generally bad luck, which seems like a reocurring theme with the Lion's franchise 

**Chiefs**

Meanwhile the Chiefs had one of their worst games in the past 2 years, they had a shit ton of turnovers, Mahomes had a bad game, yet they still somehow managed to score 34 points and get the W. The entire game just felt like the Lions had it, but by the end when it came down to a last minute drive, Chief's ball, down by 3 with 2 minutes left, you almost knew they were just going to get the touchdown and win the game.

If you have less thing to spend the debt would be lowered. if you add all the 6 states debt it's literally 200 billion USD.

So it means that the Patriots might win the Superbowl 2 to 4 wins and the next five years it's either the NEW YORK teams need 13 Superbowl wins, 

CA team need to add up to 8 Superbowl wins, and Florida also needs 6 Superbowl wins,  Missouri needs 8 Superbowl wins. Minnesota need 2 wins, PA teams need 6 Superbowl wins, Wisconsin need 2 wins, Texas 2 wins, AZ 3 wins, Washington 3 wins, Louisiana  1 or 2 wins, Tennessee 2 wins, Colorado 1 win, Georgia 3 to 4 wins, North Carolina 3 to 4 wins. Indiana 3 wins, Maryland 3 wins, Michigan 5 wins, Illinois 8 to 9 wins, Ohio 6 or 8 wins, New Jersey 6 wins,

On another note, Dak is not an elite QB. He’s not even in the same breath as Patrick Mahomes (as one Cowboys fan infamously said that they’re on the same level).

And honestly by the standard now, did the right thing and let it go. Now this adds another 10 minutes to review, the defense goes to the opposite end zone for their celebratory picture. And this one was reversed because it was “obvious” as they say. These offensive pass interference calls are already ridiculous and coaches are allowed to challenge them
now but so far close to none have been over turned. The refs are second guessing everything they do now, they throw flags because they know they can be challenged to save their own ass and think it’ll be right either way when in fact through 4 weeks, the rule hasn’t done anything but confuse a lot of coaches and fans. The Chiefs/Lions no whistle for fumble and score was correct of course which is what we wanted. But I think refs have been as much of a factor into teams winning as much as positional players but with these rule changes, I think they have complete control of the out come. They’re under so much pressure and just like the players, hesitating in football is super dangerous for the player. These refs are going to over think everything. Okay rant is over.

153,Opinion: Tanking should be a lot more frowned upon than it is,"""Suck for Luck""   
""Tank for Tua""

Tanking for a potential franchise player is actually cheered for by many fans &amp; it straight baffles me.  You can buy any one of a dozen Tank for Tua shirts right now.  To an extent I can almost empathize with a fan base for rooting for this. Almost.  You want to see your team find that missing piece that makes your team meaningful again.  While you're doing that though you're screwing over an entire roster of players, coaching staff &amp; front office personnel, most of whom are giving their all for the team THIS YEAR.  ""Listen buddy, I know you've given your all to this franchise your entire career &amp; you plan on retiring at the end of the season but don't get your hopes up for a win.  We really like this guy who may be good next year, so we're going to unload everyone with any kind of talent &amp; trade value and shoot for the bottom.""  You're also basically giving the other teams in your division 2 free wins each season.  I would much rather suck and win 4-6 games organically than lose it all to maybe get that top guy.",nfl,w--_--w,62,2019-09-30

I wanted to see what everyone thought here about the Dolphins versus the Redskins. Who do you think is worse based on what you've seen so far? Which team do you think will be picking first?

159,[OC] What does each team's first offensive play of the season tell us about their chances of winning the Super Bowl?,"So I got extremely bored over the weekend and decided to research the correlation between Super Bowl winners and the result of their first offensive play of their respective championship season. Of course we all know this means nothing but in fact it actually means everything and should be blindly trusted by everyone. First, the historical results from the last 10 years (that's the furthest back I could find, if anyone has data older than that please let me know):

Season | SB Winner | 1st Play Result
:-- | :--| :--
2009 | Saints | D. Brees pass complete to D. Henderson for 14 yards
2010 | Packers | A. Rodgers pass incomplete to J. Finley
2011 | Giants | A. Bradshaw rushes for 6 yards
2012 | Ravens | J. Flacco pass complete to T. Smith for 52 yards
2013 | Seahawks | M. Lynch rushes for 5 yards
2014 | Patriots | S. Ridley rushes for 2 yards
2015 | Broncos | C. Anderson rushes for 3 yards
2016 | Patriots | J. Garoppolo pass incomplete to C. Hogan
2017 | Eagles | C. Wentz pass incomplete to T. Smith
2018 | Patriots | R. Burkhead rushes for 6 yards

As you can see, not a lot of fireworks all things considered. However, we do know that, on their first offensive play of the season, **the last 10 Super Bowl winners HAVE**:

* Rushed using a RB with a range of 2 to 6 yards, OR
* Completed a pass to a WR with a range of 14 to 52 yards, OR
* Passed incomplete to a WR or a TE

Which means that, on their first offensive play of the season, **the last 10 Super Bowl winners HAVE NOT**:

* Committed or accepted a penalty, OR
* Turned the ball over or let the QB get sacked, OR
* Scored points, OR
* Rushed for less than 2 yards or more than 6 yards, OR
* Completed a pass for less than 14 yards or more than 52 yards, OR
* Passed incomplete to a RB, OR
* Completed a pass to a RB or TE, OR
* Rushed with anyone other than a RB

Using the above criteria, I evaluated every team's first offensive play of the 2019 season to determine who is eligible to take home the Lombardi trophy this season:

Team | 1st Play Result | Analysis
:-- | :--| :--
Patriots | S. Michel rushes for -1 yards | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards
Jets | L. Bell rushes for 5 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Bills | J. Allen pass complete to C. Beasley for 8 yards | Ineligible - pass complete less than 14 yards
Dolphins | R. Fitzpatrick pass incomplete to P. Williams | **ELIGIBLE**
Ravens | M. Ingram rushes for 49 yards | Ineligible - rush of more than 6 yards
Browns | B. Mayfield pass incomplete to R. Higgins | **ELIGIBLE**
Steelers | J. Conner rushes for 4 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Bengals | A. Dalton pass complete to T. Boyd for 3 yards | Ineligible - pass complete less than 14 yards
Titans | M. Mariota pass complete to D. Walker for 10 yards | Ineligible - pass complete to TE &amp; less than 14 yards
Colts | J. Brissett pass complete to T. Hilton for 3 yards | Ineligible - pass complete less than 14 yards
Texans | C. Hyde rushes for 9 yards | Ineligible - rush of more than 6 yards
Jaguars | L. Fournette rushes for -1 yards | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards
Chiefs | D. Williams rushes for -1 yards | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards
Chargers | A. Ekeler rushes for 2 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Broncos | N. Fant rushes for -5 yards | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards &amp; a non-RB attempt
Raiders | J . Jacobs rushes for 4 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Packers | A. Jones rushes for 0 yards | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards
Bears | Defensive holding penalty accepted | Ineligible - committed or accepted a penalty
Lions | M. Stafford pass complete to K. Johnson for 7 yards | Ineligible - pass complete to RB &amp; less than 14 yards
Vikings | Offensive holding penalty accepted | Ineligible - committed or accepted a penalty
Saints | D. Brees pass complete to A. Kamara for 9 yards | Ineligible - pass complete to RB &amp; less than 14 yards
Falcons | M. Ryan sacked for -8 yards | Ineligible - let the QB get sacked
Bucs | P. Barber rushes for 3 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Panthers | C. McCaffrey rushes for 5 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Eagles | C. Wentz pass incomplete to Z. Ertz | **ELIGIBLE**
Cowboys | D. Prescott pass complete to A. Cooper for 13 yards | Ineligible - pass complete less than 14 yards
Redskins | D. Guice rushes for 5 yards | **ELIGIBLE**
Giants | E. Manning pass complete to S. Barkley for 8 yards | Ineligible - pass complete to RB &amp; less than 14 yards
Cardinals | K. Murray pass incomplete to K. Johnson | **ELIGIBLE**
Seahawks | C. Carson rushes for 1 yard | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards
49ers | T. Coleman rushes for 1 yard | Ineligible - rush of less than 2 yards
Rams | J. Goff pass complete to C. Kupp for 6 yards | Ineligible - pass complete less than 14 yards

Congratulations to all eligible teams, you've still got a chance. Everyone else... better luck next year. And take your first offensive play seriously, the facts don't lie.

**TL:DR - Based on 100% scientific data, the only teams with a chance to win the Super Bowl this year are the Jets, Dolphins, Browns, Steelers, Chargers, Raiders, Bucs, Panthers, Eagles, Redskins and Cardinals.**",nfl,bluemexico,28,2019-09-30

2. Trades away OBJ for immaturity and OBJ is back to the shenanigans like when he was on the Giants. The frustration OBJ shows whenever he gets shut down was showcased yesterday against Marlon Humphrey. That level of frustration would’ve been bad for Daniel Jones as an evolving QB. 

3. Lets Landon Collins walk and now Collins is probably one of the most overpaid players in the league while Giants get a 3rd comp pick. Peppers has been playing much better as well for 25% of the price tag.

4. Takes Daniel Jones over Haskins, which he got a lot of crap for, and it seems like the much better decision right now. Haskins struggles mightily against a bad Giants defense and Jones continues to take strides forward. 

5. Revamped an Oline from bad to at least average, the best they’ve look since 2011.

344,Long term question about matthew Stafford,"So right up front as you can see I'm a bears fan. As such i know people have raised serious questions about our starting qb. And while i think those questions are legitimate,mitch is just in his second full season. Matthew Stafford has been in the league for a decade and had never really been anything special. I know finding a transcendent amazing new qb can be very hard but why have they chosen to stay shackled to such mediocrity for so long. Even in the last couple of draft classes they've had high picks and could have taken stand out players but seemed to ignore them. So is there really a good reason to keep around Detroit?

346,"With all the buzz about AFC v. NFC records, I figure I'd look at some stats by conference.","tl;dr Bet on the NFC this Pro Bowl, maybe be prepared to lose that bet because of turnovers

\----------------------------------OFFENSE------------------------------------

AFC Average Yards/Game:  348.7375 (Median: 350.3)

NFC Average Yards/Game:  360.68125  (Median:  377.8 )

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Points/Game: 21.1125 (Median: 21.0)

NFC Average Points/Game: 23.4 (Median: 23.8)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Passing Yards/Game: 241.18145 (Median:  240.0)

NFC Average Passing Yards/Game: 250.175 (Median:  266.3)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Rushing Yards/Game: 107.58125 (Median: 119.0) 

NFC Average Rushing Yards/Game: 110.5125 (Median:  113.3 )

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

It is close, but the NFC does have the lead in both yards and points. The only stat the AFC has the edge in is the median rushing yards/game, held by the Titans. So far, the stats back up the records.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------DEFENSE-------------------------------------

AFC Average Yards/Game:  365.875 (Median: 366.3)

NFC Average Yards/Game:  347.71875  (Median: 330.3)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Points/Game: 22.675 (Median: 23.3)

NFC Average Points/Game: 22.15625 (Median:  23.0)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Passing Yards/Game: 248.5875 (Median: 237.7)

NFC Average Passing Yards/Game: 245.03125 (Median: 238.5)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Rushing Yards/Game: 117.33125 (Median: 103.8) 

NFC Average Rushing Yards/Game: 102.7125 (Median: 96.8)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, The NFC is on top. Yards allowed is a pretty close contest, until you see the rushing yards, where the NFC has a huge lead. Again, the only thing the AFC has is a tiny lead in pass defense median, held by the Bengals.

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, turnovers. I'm not doing Special Teams stats because who cares.

\-------------------------------------TURNOVERS----------------------------

AFC Average Turnover Differential: +0.1875 (Median: +1)

NFC Average Turnover Differential: -0.1875 (Median: 0)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Takeaways: 5 (Median: 6)

NFC Average Takeaways: 5.9375 (Median: 6)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFC Average Giveaways: 4.8125 (Median: 4)

NFC Average Giveaways: 6.125 (Median: 6)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here we finally see the AFC shine. An average turnover differential that is positive as opposed to the NFC's negative, and far fewer giveaways. The NFC has a narrow lead on takeaways, however.

Conclusions:

* The AFC is kinda wack
* The NFC is pretty good, but
* The NFC is error prone

393,Does spending money equal a Super Bowl Appearance? Let's look into recent salary cap rankings and determine what you need to spend to get a Lombardi Trophy.,"Hey guys - boss is on vacation this week so I found some time to write another piece. As someone with a Finance degree, I love anything involving numbers, including stats, salary info, betting lines, you name it. However, I knew absolutely NOTHING about the NFL Salary Cap. Did some research and it's pretty straight forward - I won't bore you with details as I'm sure everyone else is pretty knowledgeable on how it works.

Every year the NFL sets a Cap Limit - the max amount one team can have outstanding on contracts. It's broken down as follows:

* Active Contracts
* \+ Injured Reserve
* \+ Dead Cap (money owed to players no longer on the team)
* = Total Cap
   * Worth noting, most available info on Teams' caps are estimates, so figures can be off a couple hundred bucks when the math is redone, chalk it up to rounding errors.

With that understanding, the natural question to ask - how much do I need to spend to win a Super Bowl?

I checked the available salary cap info from every season since 2012-2013 and the biggest thing that stuck out:

* Since 2012, the highest spending team **never appeared in the Super Bowl.** As a matter of fact, cap leaders never got past the Wild Card round.

Let's see those big spenders each year:

* 2012 - Chiefs
   * Season: 2-14, **Missed Playoffs**
* 2013 - Chiefs
   * Season: 11-5, **Lost WC game to IND 44-45**
* 2014 - Bills
   * Season: 9-7, **Missed Playoffs**
* 2015 - Jets
   * Season: 10-6, **Missed Playoffs**
* 2016 - Raiders
   * Season: 12-4, **Lost WC game to Hou 27-14**
* 2017 - Panthers
   * Season: 11-5, **Lost WC Game to NO 31-26**
* 2018 - 49ers
   * Season: 4-12, **Missed Playoffs**

Your 2019 Salary Cap Leader is: ***The Cleveland Browns***

So - spending the most money doesn't get you there. Where should you land on the ranking in order to have the best chance? I made this neat chart below to show where each winner (and loser) of the Super Bowl ranks in terms of total contract spending, and the numbers are really all over the place.

&amp;#x200B;

[Contract Numbers for Winners &amp; Losers of each Super Bowl, 2012-2019](https://i.redd.it/off3b9mdorp31.png)

The average ""Active Contracts"" by a Super Bowl winner over the last 7 years is $125,277,005, and the average position on the ranking chart (by total cap spending) is roughly 11th. So it's safe to say, with the exception of the 2016-2017 Patriots, you're gonna want to be above the league average in total cap spending, but that's all we really get from this data.

In conclusion, it doesn't appear your rank on the salary cap chart has any effect as to whether or not you'll make it to, or win, the Super Bowl. This did however prove that *Cleveland probably won't make the playoffs,* and with that conclusion, I'm more than happy.

451,Ex-NFL player shedding light on what is going on in the NFL.,"Throwaway account because I don't want to get tracked down and fined by the League for posting this, when you enter the League you must sign an NDA to not disclose any information about what goes on inside the organization. I won't give out much information regarding my career but only a select few teams I played for. I have been retired for some time now and since I am not in the NFL anymore I would like to get some things off my chest that you fans would like to hear.

I played for quite a few teams in my 9 year tenure in the league. I had a relatively successful career and was a starter for roughly 95% of my career. I really enjoyed playing ball in the NFL and the league is actually good about a lot of things regarding concussions. In the first part of my career they weren't as coherent of what was going on but after recent news of effects of repeated brain injuries they really started hammering safety and implemented a lot of good rules and precautions... but one thing the league is not good about is cheating...

Cheating is a plague in the NFL. However the NFL doesn't condone well most of it. Games aren't ""staged"" as some would say but some games are steered in that direction by dirty refs. One of the worst teams I played for was the Patriots. I have a lot of respect for Belichick but he will do anything to win the game. By anything I mean cheat or bend the rules. Most of the players have no idea what is going on unless you are a highly respected veteran and you get paid a little more under the table to help bend these rules and keep it quiet. Robert Kraft is the biggest weasel of any owner I have ever met in the league. During the 2007 ""deflategate"" scandal he orchestrated it all. Of course Brady and coach Bill caught the short end of the stick but Kraft paid off those Refs to help with it. All of us later learned of this after a couple of the Vets let us know during the game. The refs cycled the balls out for us which allowed us to get the edge. This isn't the only big time scandal the Patriots have done in the past though. Im talking pretty big scandals that are unbeknownst to the league or fans. Im talking about bounties, paying off refs to throw penalties or withhold penalties etc... Why do you think the Pats have won so many superbowls?

 Yea Brady is definitely the best QB to ever play but come on! Even greats like Manning, Rodgers, Marino, Favre and more haven't even come close to that and its because some owners are against cheating games. One of the most honest organizations I know are the Eagles, Chiefs, and Jets. Us Vets never got paid under the table to help rig games on these teams. Some of the worst orgs are the Patriots, Cowboys, and Redskins. Dan Snyder is by far the most scummy owner right up there with Robert Kraft. 

Im making this point because the NFL doesn't allow cheating and if these owners got caught it would blow up into a huge ordeal. Top of the headlines for months. The NFL however does like to stick its hands in betting money. I have never heard of them trying to rig games but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. I have heard of players who know they are clean who have a random illegal substance pop in there ""random"" drug tests but for all we know that could be NFL owners getting paid off to orchestrate that. 

TLDR; Hope you all have an understanding of what goes on in the NFL after this. Some teams cheat and some teams don't... The NFL doesn't orchestrate it but the NFL owners and coaches will. Sadly some players are even in on it.",nfl,throwawayacc244726,0,2019-09-30

5,Here is why the Dolphins are the next true dynasty in the NFL. And why other teams should take notes.,"The Dolphins, since unceremoniously allowing the Ravens to demolish them, have gone on to be the most successful expansion franchise in the NFL. The moment the Dolphins started trying to build a brand new, from scratch, in Miami, they brought a professional attitude and a clear strategy on how to build teams. Don’t miss on your draft picks, get more draft picks, and do not overpay in free agency unless the free agent is can’t miss all-pro player. That is really the gist of it. However, they did need a man who could handle the job and be able to identify talent. If they could not, this whole thing would not work.

Ownership within the organization made what could have been considered an odd choice at the time for some. Chris Grier decided to name Brian Flores the HQ of the Miami Dolphins, making Brian Flores the first black headcoach since Todd Bowles. Brian Flores was a linebacker, but his work as HQ of the Miami Dolphins should solidify Brian Flores as one of the greatest football minds in NFL history.

From the first pick, the franchise was off to great things. Trading for Josh Rosen was a fantastic move when you look back on it now, but it was not an easy choice at the time. Chris Griere wanted a quarterback in the free agnecy, his name was Ryan Fitzpatrick. A freakish athlete who was electric, but had major red flags attached to him. The upside for Fitzmagic was very high, which is why the owner of a football team would want that player. He could sell tickets!

Chris Griere had to convince Brian Flores that Fitzpatrick was the right choice, they chose Fitzparick, and I am not sure if Flores questioned a Griere player again.

Soon after that, a potentially jarring change occurred. The safety of the Dolphins for the last season, Minkah Fitzpatrick, had decided to move on. The Dolphins did not panic. They kept their head down, did their homework and decided to trade away young talent. 

The team Flores had to coach had players like Allen Hurns, Jesse Davis, Daniel Kilgore, Devante Parker, etc. Flores knew he had talent, and Flores got the best out of the team. He did things like fining players for saying “playoffs” before the team had actually made the playoffs. Then as soon as they are in the locker room after winning the game to take them to the playoffs, he tells the team to aim for the super bowl.

Fast forward to the start of 2019. The NFL is a little bit different than in 2018, but the dolphins are still playing a similar style of football, just not with the same results. AB was gold in the preseason but seemed to retire after becoming the highest-paid Widereciever in the league. He had sloppy instagram posts, did not seem to care at all, and quite honestly had the worst helmet in the entire league. He still does. But the Dolphins noticed something that preseason in the NFL, they saw the prolific Cam Newton lead offense.

Teams were getting blown away because Cam Newton was quite honestly a mismatch. Tall, fast, and big, but not deadly accurate. He lost his ""best player on the Panthers Award"" to Christian McCaffrey before the season and it did not even matter. That team played the bucs on thursday and lost to a team that had Jameis Winston, OJ Howard, Mike Evans and Peyton Barber on the roster.

The Dolphins saw this and said, “I think we can do that but better, we just need a proper dual-threat QB.”

Enter Jacuzzi Josh. The Dolphins have usually drafted players by watching the tape and understanding a player’s mindset before drafting them. The Dolphins watched the tape and understood Josh’s mindset. Josh Rosen had the mindset of a winner, just like every other player they draft, but his talent was off the charts. This was their QB! Then the Dolphins decided to let other teams completely misevaluate a player with the highest ceiling in the draft.

They have the 62nd pick in the 2019 NFL draft. Then at 62 they trade for the Arizona Cardinals the pick for Josh Rosen. As a Dolphins fan, this was a head-scratcher to me. We had a big need at wide receiver, come to think of it, the Dolphins have always had a need at receiver! Why not Jarvis Landry? Why not Kenny Stills? Then the Dolphins went for the slam dunk trade of the 2019 NFL draft, Josh Rosen. The Dolphins used some of the picks they had acquired trading down to trade back up and gather Rosen more help. The Dolphins did not have a 2nd round pick in that draft, but they did somehow manage to pick a Joe Thomas like Michale Deiter. Then follow that up by drafting a linebacker whose got a silly name like Van Ginkel. A pick like that is by design, not luck.

The experts were doubtful of Rosen all year, after all, isn’t he just a running back playing QB? Could he throw with accuracy down the field? Could his body take the pounding? ETC.

However, many draft experts did agree that Josh Rosen was in the perfect place to grow as a QB. Ryan Fitzpatrick started the season and had taken the team to a measly 0-1 start, including a brutal 10-59 loss to the Ravens. Brian Flores decided that the 22-year-old QB would not start for the rest of the season. Rosen showed off his mental toughness for the rest of that season, something that every QB drafted before him still needs to show.

Just to recap his amazing first season with the Cardinals, he finishes the season 3-13, with the one loss coming to Seattle  where they lost by 3. He gets completely demolished in the discussion of the playoff debacle, but then something happens. The coaching staff finally allows Josh Rosen to throw the ball down the field instead of eating sacks. They allowed him to be the QB that he was meant to be. He had 3 quarters of Joe Flacco style football but almost won the game in the 4th Quarter against a stacked seattle team. Would Baker Mayfield have the mental toughness to do that, or would he throw 3 picks like he did against Tennessee?

The doubters did not silence all offseason, but all Josh Rosen did was stay silent and work. And the front office went to work as well. The front office identified a need for speed on the offense to help replicate what Carolina did in 2015. So they traded away the fastest player in Kenny Stills. The Dolphins then traded away his protection in Laremy Tunsil, a huge tackle with high character. Not to mention watching their entire team ask for a trade. Are you kidding me?

A quick look at the current Dolphins roster shows very few weaknesses. A good Oline anchored by Daniel Kilgore. A young, but very talented secondary, and 4 tight ends who can assist Josh Rosen by not only blocking but all three have great hands. When you also have running backs like Kenyan Drake, Kalen Ballage, and Mark Walton as a backfield that is a deadly offense.

The Dolphins have always had a great defense. That is why the Dolphins this past offseason lost a ton of players and did not panic, all they did was shop around future Hall of Famer in Minkah Fitzpatrick.

Josh Rosen just had a perfect passer rating in his first game of madden this season and he is 22 on a cheap rookie deal. The Dolphins in the offseason will have around every pick in the draft and close to $100 million in cap room. If Josh Rosen wants to be the next Tom Brady, the Dolphins have certainly set him up for at least a chance at that lofty goal.",nfl,platoprincipal,11,2019-09-15

10,Top 30 Quarterbacks of the last 40 years (10-1),"Part 1: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/d3c5o6/top_30_quarterbacks_of_the_last_40_years_3021/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Part 2: 1:https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/d3suww/top_30_quarterbacks_of_the_last_40_years_2011/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

This is part three of the 30 greatest QBs of the last 40 years. For me, these were clearly the top 10 guys. Number 10 was easy for me to rank, as well as the top 3. Numbers 4-9 was another story. All six of those QBs were very close in my mind. I think reasonable people can have completely different rankings of those guys. 

**10. Ben Roethlisburger-**  Roethlisburger was drafted the same year as Rivers and Eli. He has had the best career of the three. Surpassing both the regular season prowess of Rivers, and Eli's post season accomplishments. Roethlisburger has an incredible 144-70-1 record. Since 1979 Roethlisburger ranks 7th in both, passing TDs and AV with 363 TDs and 185 career AV. 

Roethlisburger's playoff record is equally impressive. His 13 post season wins ties him for 6th all time. His 30 passing TDs ties him for 9th. Roethlisburger is a two time Super Bowl champion. 

**9. Drew Brees-** As I stated in my preamble, 4-9 is a virtual tie for me, and I have no problem with you having Brees all the way up at #4. I'm going to spend the rest of this little spiel nit picking Bress's brilliant career, trying to justify this ranking.

Brees is the only QB in the top nine to not have an MVP. You might say that is a weak argument, as you can point to multiple seasons where he could have easily earned one. I agree to some extent, but I also don't think there was ever a time Brees was the best QB in the league, or even top two. For his whole career at least Brady and Manning, or Brady and Rodgers were the better QB. 

Brees is tied for the least playoff wins with eight and has the worst career winning% with .591 of the top ten. The bulk of his top 5 case relies on the staggering TD totals and passing yards he has accumulated over his career. There is a good chance he finishes his career first in both of those categories all time. He will also have the most pass attempts of all time. Brees has benefited from playing in a dome most of his career. He also had one of the best offensive minds of his era as head coach. Payton built a high flying offense based around Brees flinging it 40+ times per game during the most QB friendly era in NFL history.

I don't want to diminish Brees's incredible statistical accomplishments, but it is important to give the context in which he achieved those lofty stats. In short Brees was never the best QB in the league, won at the lowest rate of the top ten QBs, and his perfect situation inflated his stats.

**8. Steve Young-** Young's peak can match any in history. At his absolute zenith from 1992-94 Young was simply transcendent. Over that span Young led the NFL all three years in passer rating, ANY/Y, TDs, TD%, and AV. He was First Team All Pro all three years, won two MVPs, a Super Bowl and a Super Bowl MVP. His record over those three seasons was 37-11. In '93 and '94 Young posted AVs of 23. Only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 has matched that. Only Tom Brady in 2007 has surpassed it with 24. 

Young had many superb seasons outside of his peak as well. He was an excellent rushing QB, gaining 4,239 yds and 43 TDs on the ground for his career. Young was also one of the most efficient passers of all time. Since 1979 Young has the 3rd best career AY/A, the 6th best passer rating, and the 5th best TD%. He also had a .657 career winning% with a 94-49 record. 

Young did not become the starter for the 49ers until he was 30 and took over in 1991. This gives him a shorter career than everyone except Rodgers in the top 10. Young's career totals can't match the rest of the QBs in this range. People will also minimize Young's accomplishments by pointing to the revolutionary offense he was in, and having the GOAT wide reciever in Jerry Rice at his disposal. While this is a fair point, I think in his prime Young maxed out what is possible to do at the quarterback position, and undoubtedly deserves a spot in the top 10.

**7. Brett Favre-** Favre was the ultimate gunslinger and iron man in NFL history. He had a career unlike any other, which included a record 297 straight starts. When he retired in 2010 Favre was the all time career leader in TDs, passing yards, wins and AV. His three MVP awards, which he won in consecutive years, are only matched by Brady, and only surpassed by Peyton. Favre had 13 career playoff wins, and went to two Super Bowls winning one. His 44 career playoff TD passes are 3rd best all time. 

The main thing that kept Favre from being ranked higher were his late game post season errors contributing to his 11 playoff losses. Favre had questionable judgement often, and could throw you out of a game as fast as he could throw you into one. His famous improvisation, and all time great arm misfired too often for me to rank him top 5. Favre threw the most interceptions in NFL history, and has the highest Int% of all the QBs in the top 10. 


**6. Dan Marino**
**5.  John Elway**

These two all time greats were drafted together in 1983. I go back and forth deciding which one had the greater career. I will probably have a different answer tomorrow. They were the two most prolific QBs of their era. From 1979-1999 Marino and Elway were both either first or second in career passing yards, passing TDs, wins, and AV. They are tied with Warren Moon for the most Pro Bowl appearances with 9 and each won an MVP. 

Marino was clearly the better QB if you go by only regular season accomplishments. His biggest edge comes in TD passes where he had 420 compared to only 300 for Elway. Marino also has a better passer rating 86.4 to 79.9, AY/A 6.99 to 6.52, TD% 5 to 4.1, a lower Int% 3.02 to 3.12 and higher AV 216 to 203

Elway did have a slightly better record than Marino, edging him 148-82-1 to 147-93. Elway was also a much more mobile QB, accumulating 3,407 yds and 33 TDs on the ground. Marino was a virtual statue by comparison with only 87 career rushing yards and 9 TDs. 

Where Elway really closes the gap is in the post season. Elway won two Superbowls, while Marino never won one. Elway had the far superior playoff record as well going 14-7 compared to Marino's 8-10. It is Elway's superior post season resume that leads me to give him the edge, and say he had the greater career. I do believe Marino was the better QB, and that it was him never having a quality defense, and not any fault of his own that resulted in his poor playoff record. 

**4. Aaron Rodgers-**  I anticipate this being my most controversial ranking of this group, with many in the comments calling my list trash for this placement alone. I remind you again the the quarterbacks 4-9 are extremely close for me, and I have no problem with you saying you would drop Rodgers several spots. 

I have said many times that this is a ranking of the greatest QBs since 1979, and not the best, but being the best goes a long way towards greatness. I think Rodgers is the best QB of all time. From a pure scouting, eyeball test perspective Rodgers is unsurpassed. 

The numbers back up my eyes. Since 1979 Rodgers has the highest TD%, the lowest Int%, the highest passer rating, as well as the highest AY/A and ANY/A. In every advanced stat that measures passing efficiency Rodgers is the best. Rodgers did this playing outdoors in a cold weather home field, never had an elite head coach, or all time great weapons. 

Rodgers has a hall of fame resume as well. He has earned two MVPs, joining only Peyton, Brady, Montana, Favre and Warner with multiple MVPs since 1979. He's 10th in pass TDs since 1979 with 339, and 10th in career AV with 170. His 101-57-1 record gives him an excellent .639 winning%. 

Rodgers has won one Super Bowl. He has nine playoff wins and his  36 TDs is good for 5th most all time. Both totals are better than Young and Brees. Rodgers top 10 resume in conjunction with being the best QB of all time is why I ranked him this high. 

**3. Peyton Manning-**  Manning is the greatest regular season QB of all time. His regular season accomplishments dwarf every other QB in the history of the NFL. If Belicheck and Brady never teamed up to repeatedly block Peyton in the playoffs, he could easily be at the top spot on this ranking. 

Manning earned seven First Team All Pro selections. The second most by one QB since 1979 is three. Peyton has a staggering five MVP awards. No one else has more than three. Manning has the highest AV if all time, and the second most wins. Peyton is also the all time leader in TD passes. 

Though his playoff resume is not as impressive as the top two on this list, he is no slouch. Peyton won two Super Bowls, he is 4th all time for playoff passing TDs with 40. He is 5th all time in playoff wins with 14. Manning's 13 playoff losses and the greatness of the top two keep him from being ranked higher. 


**2. Joe Montana-**  The undisputed GOAT until Brady snatched the crown from him a few years ago. Montana is is a four time  champion with a perfect 4-0 record in the Super Bowl. Montana also has the second most playoff wins and TD passes all time with his sterling 16-7 post season record and 45 TD passes.  

Montana was also extremely good in the regular season. He has a 117-47 record giving him an incredible .713 winng%. From 1979-2000  Montana had the 2nd best passer rating with 92.3, the 4th best TD% with 5.1 and the 2nd best Int% with 2.58. Montana also had the 4th most passing yards and TDs for that time period. 

Montana was the an historically efficient regular season QB, and the most accomplished post season QB in the history of the NFL before Brady. 

**1. Tom Brady-**  Do I really need to explain this?

- 6 Super Bowl Wins
- 30 playoff wins
- 73 post season TD passes

All these accomplishments are so far beyond absurd. I could go on, but why bother. Brady is the GOAT, and it's not even close to debatable.",nfl,Tatumisgod1022,142,2019-09-15

21,How often do backup QBs get the opportunity to actually play?,"The QB position is one position I never really paid attention to and didn’t care for in general when I first started watching football  .i only started actually caring and worrying about the position when my team(the broncos) was dealing with Trevor seimian, Brock osweiler, and Case Keemun. I thought case Keemun would be great but I was disappointed about how our season went. 

Right now I’m optimistic about joe Flacco.  Dude won a super bowl and he has some good experience under his belt. Sounds like a better option than our previous QBs in the last 2 years.

Anyways regarding my question. How often do backups get the opportunity to perform???

QBs like cardale Jones, Aj McCaron, nick mullens, terry bridgewater, chase Daniel and etc??

I noticed that  backups for great quarterbacks  could sit on the bench for entire seasons. With the limited amount of experience some of the younger back ups have I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they were garbage.",nfl,soulking1997,18,2019-09-15

23,Does the NFC get overrated?,"I feel like people generally consider the NFC the far superior conference. People will always cite either how much more competitive it is, and put a lot of NFC teams on a higher pedestal than AFC teams, even if there is no merit to it as it pertains to the current game.

I believe this is for a few reasons:

\- NFC has a lot more teams that are considered ""sexy"" teams. This includes all 4 of the NFC East franchises, franchises like the Packers, Bears &amp; 49ers. Even franchises like the Saints/Falcons/Vikings/Seahawks have a lot more sexiness to them than franchises like the Titans/Jaguars/Chargers/Bengals.

\- The only real marquee franchises in the AFC are the Patriots, Steelers and Broncos. Some teams like the Raiders &amp; Dolphins have a lot of historical significance, but both have been completely irrelevant for the last two decades. Even in the case of the Patriots it's all really in the last 20 years. The Patriots before Brady/Belichick were no more significant to the NFL than a team like the Texans or Panthers are now.

For these two reasons, I believe the NFC gets a bit overrated. I think a lot of people will say that the NFC is a lot more competitive, but lack the context that no team in the conference has been as good or consistent as the Patriots (Or even the Steelers) the last 20 years. Very few (if any) NFC Franchises would have achieved more success than the Ravens/Broncos/Colts in the last 15-20 years if they were in the AFC.

Furthermore, the AFC has consistently won the head to head series over the NFC the last 20+ years. Since 1996 - the AFC has beaten the NFC in head to head matchups 15 times. The NFC has beaten the AFC 5 times. (Rest are exact ties)

As far as SB's go - the AFC is also much better off. Since 1996, the AFC has won 14 SB's and the NFC 9. If you remove all the SB's the Patriots have been in it's still 8-5 in favor of the AFC.

25,Giants fan from Australia,"Hello fellow NFL followers. Im a Giants fan from Australia and coming over to the US at the end of the year to watch some NBA and NFL including my beloved Giants play at Metlife on the 29/12.
Im also thinking about going to the Giants @ Redskins game on the 22/12 and wondering whether its safe enough for me to attend on my own as a Giants fan? In Aus, we have Australian Football and theres some stadiums you’d be silly to attend on your own away from your home state. 
If its deemed safe enough to go - is there anywhere specifically I should sit as an opposition supporter? Should I refrain from wearing Giants merch?

86,Are there people out there who root for two NFL teams??,"I am a guy who was born in Texas(College Station if you know where that is!!) and currently live overseas.

My first experience with the NFL was a Cowboys VS Raiders preseason game where the Cowboys won 3:0(the score was so shocking I still remember it LOL) and after a few weeks into the regular season, the Texans caught my eye as well!! Arian Foster and JJwatt looked so cool that I instantly bought a Foster jersey and a Jason Witten Jersey!!


Since then, I started to root for both Texas teams, and since they were each in the NFC and AFC, I dreamed of them playing in the SuperBowl against each other!!

98,"Chicago Bears vs Denver Broncos,LIVE (2018) ONLine | FuLL StrEamiNg*!",[removed],nfl,gordemutro,0,2019-09-15
100,Combining Kicker/Punter Roles,"I know there are long established reasons for a Kicker and a Punter to be different players, and the mechanics of each are entirely different, but how long do you think it will be before we start seeing teams experiment with only signing one guy?

There have been several recent instances where a punter has had to stand in for an injured kicker, usually with success at least at short and medium ranges. Not too long ago it was common for teams to carry a specialist kick off guy but they've gone by the wayside.

It seems that as teams are using more and more specialised personnel elsewhere, with third down/short yardage backs, pass rushing DTs, nickel corners and sub-package linebackers, blocking tight ends, etc, combined with more and more players and coaches looking to the world of rugby for inspiration and talent, it feels like only a matter of time before someone looks at the kicker and says ""our punter can probably manage that, we could use the extra roster spot""...",nfl,iron-raven,7,2019-09-15
101,Kurt Warner just said that the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor on Gameday Morning,Just in case you didn’t think he had CTE.,nfl,ASTRO2598,17,2019-09-15
102,"Chicago vs Denver, Live#2018 Streaming!! | Full Online*",[removed],nfl,yulicaziju,0,2019-09-15
107,Kurt Warner just said the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor,"during his browns hype monologue for the match-up.

He was asking if they thought it was over in Cleveland and preceded to ask if it was over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor.

I realize its just a slip, but damn come on man.",nfl,attisal73,61,2019-09-15
110,NFL=||Denver Broncos vs Chicago Bears Live Stream NFL football Watch Free,[removed],nfl,wasalutona,0,2019-09-15
113,Question: Do agents suffer any financial penalties or required to return any fees when a client is fined or required to return any part of their salary?,"Just seems a bit unfair for an agent to tell their players to sit there and get fined while agent suffers no consequence.  I'm sure that they consider how future contracts will affect them and THAT specific player.  But can't that also be used as a ploy to attract other clients?  ""Man...... that agent really looks out for his players"".

This is all 100% pure theory and not at all based on anything I've read or heard.  Just a thought , that's all.",nfl,tercra,4,2019-09-15
116,Anybody have an tips for watching live games using a PS4? I’m willing to pay for whatever pass I need I would just like to hear your guy’s thoughts on the best app or service to use,,nfl,airpranes,17,2019-09-15
117,Is Tyreek Hill faster than Hollywood Brown?,"IMO Tyreek’s speed gets a little overrated. He was a nationally dominant sprinter in high school, but he’s bulked up a lot since then and focused more on route running than maintaining speed.

I think it’s fair to say Hollywood Brown could be faster just because he’s younger and more spry",nfl,f0xhead,62,2019-09-15
118,Why was the Saints Defense so atrocious during the early to mid 2010s?,They were 7-9 because of it for a couple of seasons. There was even some rumor that Sean Payton was going to be fired because of that?,nfl,Tico483,33,2019-09-15

125,Who else thinks the Dolphins should make their throwbacks their primary uniforms?,,nfl,flowgod123,14,2019-09-15
127,Tom Brady @ Miami versus Vegas,"Throughout TB’s career, he is 7-10 in Miami. His record against the spread is 6-11. He has been favored for 95 points and underdogged for 21.5 points, setting his overall line at 73.5. The score differential between the Pats total points in TB’s career and this overall line is -75.5. 

Today the Patriots are favored by 18.5. Do you bet with or against this spread?",nfl,EmeraldV,12,2019-09-15
128,Does the league have weight or size restrictions on certain positions?,"Random thought this morning while getting ready for work. Say you have a guy that’s like Nate Solder’s size, but he’s terrible on the o-line. 

What if you slapped a wide receiver  number on him, put him in the slot, used him on the goal line and in certain short yardage situations?

He basically would just body up anyone you had to cover him, he could probably be useful for run blocking. Idk just a random thought.",nfl,wingbark,19,2019-09-15
130,Why can’t the NFL more evenly distribute their game times? Today there’s 10 early games and only 3 late games,"It’s annoying as hell because red zone sucks after the early games end. There’s a lot of idle time. And you miss a lot in the early games because there’s so much going on. 

/rant",nfl,EPIC_FAIL_73,6,2019-09-15
131,Anyone else not buying the ravens hype and wouldn't be surprised if they somehow lose to the cardinals?,,nfl,WonderfulPessimism,32,2019-09-15
133,That “Free Phone Football” commercial where They whisper it over and over again is the most annoying commercial I have ever seen in my entire life.,It’s kind of funny because the product is Something that I would try but will now not try simply because of how unbelievably irritable the commercial makes me. I literally scramble for my remote to press mute every single time it comes on.,nfl,ADriedUpGoliath,13,2019-09-15

140,Why isn't tanking considered consumer fraud?,People pay good money to see these games based on the idea that they're seeing two teams trying to beat each other. Tanking hurts the integrity of the game. Is it because you can't prove they're tanking?,nfl,No_One_On_Earth,14,2019-09-15

32,Why Lamar Jackson won't be successful,"Just to clarify I'm not shitting on Lamar just to shit on him. I'm generally concerned on his play. So let's jump right into it.

**Negatives**

- 32nd Ranked passer with a clean pocket per PFF

- Worst accuracy (Based on ball placement not completions) of a starting NFL QB per PFF

- Doesn't have the bulk to heavily rely on the run to avoid injuries. (6'2 216lbs)

- Poor accuracy while throwing on the run


**Positives**

- 147 rushing attempts in 7 games last year. This will be hard for defenses and keep them guessing

- Has a Big Arm, can throw the ball deep down field 

- Explosive play ability

- Mental toughness 

If you take all this information and put it all together. Lamar Jackson looks more like a RB than a QB considering all of his rushing ability. If he can steadily improve ball placement and accuracy I think he can be successful. In college he had a lot of problems creating turnovers. If he can fix that he can be very good but there is a lot to factor into fixing that (Ball security, ball placement, decision making etc...) If the Offensive Coordinator can work around Jackson's Talent it can make it easier for him. Run Pass Option plays are going to be kind to Jackson if they can factor it in heavily. Jackson's accuracy alone doesn't make him a good QB, his ability to run around the pocket and make mismatches will but his throwing while on the run is nowhere near accurate. 

There is a lot resting on his shoulders. With Flacco gone this is Jacksons show to run. He has a lot of hype to live up to, he is probably the most overhyped QB of the second year QBs. His ceiling is having a similar career to Vick. He has a lot of the same throwing style, release, and ability Vick had. Vick was a Madden God but in reality Vick wasn't a great QB. He was dangerous, and he was good but not great. Vick had a very dangerous big play ability without that Vick would of been average. Lamar can be very dangerous in the same aspect but only time will tell. He does have the ability to succeed but he has a tendency to to turn the ball over quite often and lacks above average accuracy. You're gonna say ""Well Iamyungace Lamar had 6TD 3int and a 84.5 passer rating last season."" Yes you are right but ball placement wasn't very good at all. He made his receivers work to catch those balls and now teams have film on him and going to play to his disadvantage. He needs to adapt to this quick in order to get success. The Ravens season rests on Lamar Jackson's shoulders.

The Ravens should of kept Flacco (who is an average to above average QB) and split snaps between him and Lamar similar to last season. That would of made the Ravens very dangerous and was a good reason they won the games they did win last year. In all seriousness Lamar can be very good but like I said 'he has a lot of hype to live up to.' He needs to work on the negatives and strengthen the positives to be successful. If not, the Ravens will be looking for a new QB in the next couple years. 


 I wish him the best and he will be fun to watch this season. I hope he improves and proves me wrong. Like everyone else I want him to succeed. I like Jackson's personality and his character. He is a good leader, and a good kid.",nfl,I_Am_YungAce,0,2019-08-31

5,Why do people shit on Eli Manning?,"First off, let me say I am not a Giants fan or even an Eli fan. But as a fan of the game and a former QB myself, it really boggles my mind when people have slammed Eli. Is Eli on par with Brady, Brees, Rodgers or even Phil Rivers? Obviously not but the guy was very good, even with moments of greatness.

Let’s be honest; for the majority of Eli’s career, the Giants OL wasn’t exactly elite. Eli was INT prone at times, especially in his younger years. But a fair amount of his INTs were because of the OL flopping or the receiver not running the right route. Up until Odell, Eli wasn’t blessed in the WR department. He got about 2 years out of Plaxico Burress before he had to shoot himself up at the club. He got 1 year out of Steve Smith and also got only 2 years out of Hakeem Nicks. The one WR who had great potential(Cruz) suffered a freak injury that ultimately ended his career.

As far as the postseason, Eli has been money. In the 2 SB runs, Eli played in 8 combined games and threw for 15 TD/2 INT while completing over 63% of his passes. The 16 game pace would be 30 TD/4 INT. That is some ungodly efficiency. That’s basically Aaron Rodgers-like. And this doesn’t including Eli besting Brady for both his SBs while winning SB MVP both times. Eli may have had some less than flattering moments during his career, but he was absolutely money when the marbles were all on the line which is a lot more than we can say for his big bro. If people want to ignore Eli for their SB wins, then you can’t blame him when they lose. Fair is fair. 

Eli has been a very serviceable QB in his career and extremely durable. He has done more than anyone could’ve asked for given his lack of help at times. He is in the top 10 all-time in passes completed, yards and TDs. If you’re in a one game must win, there aren’t many I would take before Eli. I would take him over his brother any day of the week.",nfl,kidink0222,58,2019-08-16

Over the weekend, we’re going to determine the best 7-on-7 team in NFL history using just one player per round. We’ve eliminated 24 teams so far, and we’re down to the final eight. By the end of the day, four more teams will be eliminated, as we reach the Final Four. For now, we have some more results to get to, and some voting to do to determing which teams will be one step closer to winning the crown.

Again, this is a single-elimination style tournament with standard bracket seeding, where in each conference, the #1 seed plays the #16 seed, the #8 seed plays the #9 seed, etc. You get one vote. Whichever team gets the most votes moves onto the next round. Here’s how the voting schedule is going to look:

- **Friday, August 16:** Elite Eight Voting

- **Saturday, August 17:** Final Four Voting

- **Sunday, August 18:** Championship Voting

---

**Yesterday’s Results (60 votes)**

- **New England Patriots (71.7%)** defeat **Oakland Raiders (28.3%)**

- **Buffalo Bills (70%)** defeat **Denver Broncos (30%)**

- **Pittsburgh Steelers (76.7%)** defeat **Baltimore Ravens (23.3%)**

- **Kansas City Chiefs (58.3%)** defeat **Miami Dolphins (41.7%)**

- **Dallas Cowboys (61.7%)** defeat **Los Angeles Rams (38.3%)**

- **New York Giants (55%)** defeat **Minnesota Vikings (45%)**

- **San Francisco 49ers (63.6%)** defeat **Green Bay Packers (36.7%)**

- **Chicago Bears (70%)** defeat **Seattle Seahawks (30%)**

---

Remember that for this tournament, the teams are playing on a smaller field more suited for 7-on-7 (so players can’t just run around each other on an NFL-sized field). Special teams are excluded. All you have to do is vote on the Google form for each matchup. To make it easy, much like I did with the [/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c7s9ez/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_series_finale/?st=jz9fn54r&amp;sh=6f6d5a30), the teams will be listed in the form so you don’t have to hop back and forth between tabs.

The teams are seeded based on their lifetime winning percentage. And, the bracket and every team is listed in the hub, which is at the top of the post.

93,Phil Jackson would carry an air-pressure gauge with him because teams would cheat by tampering with basketballs,"excerpt from The Jordan Rules by Sam Smith

&gt; Jackson always tests the poundage in the game balls before the game. Like the night in Miami in the 1989-90 season. The balls this night in Miami were well below the required 7.5 to 8.5 pounds. An innocent oversight? Unlikely. With a softer ball players can't dribble as fast and the game slows. It was what a less talented team like Miami wanted against a running team like the Bulls. Jackson got the balls pumped up and the Heat were deflated. It works the other way, too; Jackson has caught the Lakers trying to sneak balls with 15 to 17 pounds of air into the game. Why? Magic likes a high dribble, and a livelier ball results in long rebounds that key the kind of fast break the Lakers love to use.

158,Stop predicting the Saints Rams Patriots and Chiefs as the top 4 teams in 2019,"The top two seeds in each conference rarely stay the same, and everyone in the preseason seems to forget that, and then they come around by like Week 6 of the regular season. Power rankings and fans like to predict the championship game teams are just gonna be the same 4 teams in the championship game next year, which is almost never the case. Here’s a Microsoft Paint illustration of playoff berths since realignment: https://m.imgur.com/a/R6tqW3I

As you can see, the only times the top 2 seeds in a conference stayed the same was when Peyton Manning and Tom Brady were in the same conference (they did it 4 times in a row). People might argue Mahomes is the next coming of Jesus and will match Tom Brady in record and performance, and by all means I can agree with that, but it is definitely against the probability. Vegas Odds on the same 4 teams is definitely a scam, especially if you are a hopeful fan of one of the 4 teams. 

The AFC and NFC Championship games have seen 68 teams in 17 years. How many make it back to the CG the next year? Well to answer this question let’s go up the line...

39/64 CG teams make the playoffs the next year. That’s right, there’s a 40% chance the Chiefs Rams Saints or Patriots miss the playoffs altogether. Of course this won’t happen with the Patriots but just saying. This happened to both the Jaguars and Vikings in 2017 who missed the playoffs this year.

25/64 CG teams win their division the next year. A surprising amount of wild cards in here, which may result from a championship push in a previous year to barely in contention the next. The most recent example I can think of is the 2017 Eagles.

17/64 CG teams get a first round bye the next year. This is the one I’m trying to highlight. There’s about a 25% chance that any of the Saints, Rams, Chiefs, or Patriots get a 1/2 seed, or only 1 of the 4 teams will be a top seed again, which means the Patriots are just gonna keep their first round bye streak alive.

17/64 CG teams make the CG again the next year. I found it surprising that this was the exact same number as the first round bye, but it makes sense - averaged into 17 years, exactly 1 of the 4 teams will appear in the 2020 Championship Games, and it will probably still be the Patriots.

10/64 CG teams make the SB the next year. About a 15% chance that one of the top 4 2018 teams will be in next year’s SB. Power rankings and Instagram polls are so 2018-biased and make it seem like there’s a 50% chance the Rams make the SB, and the other 50% goes to the Saints. This is not true and will never be true as the NFL is a changing landscape every year and history cannot be ignored.

4/64 CG teams have won the SB the next year. The Steelers once in 05 and the other 3 were the Patriots soooo yeah.

Keep in mind I’m not a Patriots fan I’m a Chiefs fan. I’m just being cautiously pessimistic and generally realistic. Power rankings may overrate these teams because their current team circumstances give no reason to doubt them, but statistics definitely give a reason to doubt. Have a good preseason folks.",nfl,IceFreezer304,151,2019-08-16
166,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 81)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 81: 2000 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 3, 2000-January 28, 2001

Teams: 31

2000 NFL Draft: 254 selections (7 rounds), held in New York City, NY.

2000 First Draft Pick: Courtney Brown, Defensive End from Pennsylvania State University (Cleveland Browns)

2000 AP Most Valuable Player: Marshall Faulk, Running Back (St. Louis Rams)

Super Bowl XXXV: Baltimore Ravens (AFC) defeated New York Giants (NFC) 34-7 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, FL.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-In order to cut down on group celebrations, unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and fines will be assessed for celebrations by two or more players.

\-Anyone wearing an eligible number (1 to 49 or 80 to 89) can play quarterback without having to first report to the referee before a play.

\*This rule change resulted in the increase of trick plays teams can employ on offense.

\-The “Bert Emanuel” rule was implemented, stating that when making a catch and falling to the ground, the ball is allowed to touch the ground and still be considered a catch if the player maintains clear control of the ball.

Starting in 1990, the league added 2 additional playoff teams to round out the playoff field to 12 teams (6 from each conference). From 1990 to the end of the 2001 season, there were 3 division winners per conference as well as 3 wild cards. The top 2 division winners would have a bye week to the divisional round, while the others played on wild card weekend. Since 1990, the league altered the rules of division opponents facing off in the divisional round of the playoffs, there was ban on that until 1990, but now division opponents can meet any weekend of the post-season (except the Super Bowl). The highest seeds remaining after the divisional round would host the conference title games.

The playoff qualifiers were:

|*AFC*|*Seed*|*NFC*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tennessee Titans (13-3) \[Central\]|*#1*|New York Giants (12-4) \[East\]|
|Oakland Raiders (12-4) \[West\]|*#2*|Minnesota Vikings (11-5) \[Central\]|

AFC Championship Game: Baltimore Ravens defeated Oakland Raiders 16-3 at Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland, CA.

**Super Bowl XXXV**

The Baltimore Ravens and New York Giants competed in Super Bowl XXXV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, FL. The attendance was 71,921 while CBS handled the broadcast duties. The Ravens were favored by 3 points.

Both defenses dominated early in the first quarter as the first five possessions of the game ended in punts. On the fifth punt, Ravens kickoff/punt returner Jermaine Lewis returned the ball 33 yards to the New York 31-yard line. Although a holding penalty on the return moved the ball back to the 41-yard line, Baltimore took only two plays to score on quarterback Trent Dilfer's 38-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley.

Early in the second quarter, a holding penalty against the Giants nullified linebacker Jessie Armstead's 43-yard interception return for a touchdown that would have tied the game. Later in the period, Dilfer completed a 44-yard pass to receiver Qadry Ismail to set up a 47-yard field goal by Ravens kicker Matt Stover to extend Baltimore's lead, 10–0. With the aid of a 27-yard run from running back Tiki Barber, the Giants advanced all the way to the Ravens' 29-yard line on their ensuing drive, but Baltimore defensive back Chris McAlister intercepted a pass from quarterback Kerry Collins to keep New York scoreless at halftime.

The Giants forced the Ravens to punt on the opening drive of the second half. Five plays later, Ravens safety Kim Herring intercepted Collins at the New York 41-yard line. The Ravens then advanced to the 24-yard line, but the drive stalled and Stover missed a 41-yard field goal attempt.

After an exchange of punts, Ravens defensive back Duane Starks intercepted a pass from Collins and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown, setting off a chain of events unseen before in Super Bowl history: three touchdowns on three consecutive plays in 36 seconds. On the ensuing kickoff, Ron Dixon returned the ball 97 yards for the Giants' first and only score of the game. But Jermaine Lewis returned the next kickoff 84 yards for a touchdown, making the score 24–7 for the Ravens. It was the first time in history two kickoffs were returned for touchdowns in the same Super Bowl game, and on back-to-back kickoffs.

The Giants gained only one first down on their final four possessions, and were never able to move the ball into Baltimore territory. Meanwhile, the Ravens added 10 more points to their lead, making the final score 34–7. A few possessions after Jermaine Lewis' touchdown, Giants punter Brad Maynard's 34-yard punt from his own 4 to the 38-yard line and tight end Ben Coates' 17-yard reception set up a 3-yard touchdown run by running back Jamal Lewis early in the fourth quarter. Dixon fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Ravens defender Robert Bailey, setting up Stover's 34-yard field goal with 5:27 left in the game. There would be no more scoring in the game as time would expire and the Ravens would clinch the win.

The win gave the 5-year old Baltimore Ravens their first Super Bowl title. They would return to the Super Bowl 12 years later in Super Bowl XLVII where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31. The New York Giants would return to 2 more Super Bowls (XLII and XLVI) where they defeated the New England Patriots 17-14 and 21-17.

* Maurice Harris, 6'3"", free agent signing
* Demaryius Thomas, 6'3"", free agent signing
* Cameron Meredith, 6'3"", free agent signing

And of course, now Josh Gordon (6'3"") has been reinstated.

Furthermore, in the 2nd round of this year's draft, Belichick drafted 6'4"" CB Joejuan Williams to pair up with Stephon Gilmore (6'1"") to defend these type of guys on other teams.

If anyone wonders where Belichick thinks offense (and by association, defense) is or should be headed, I think this evidence is a pretty good indication at the moment.

On the grip of the ball, I've heard people say 2-3 fingers on the laces. How should you determine how many to have? Furthermore, where should the laces be along the fingers? From what I've seen alot of people choose the proximal interphalangeal joint. 
I have also seen some quarterbacks wear gloves. What is recommended on this stance?
Finally, do you guys have any media examples that would help to develop and of entertainment regarding quarterbacks and football in general? Books, films, articles, series etc.

Mainstream media has not put an emphasis on o-line yet and that was one of the problems with our organization last year. Wins are made through the trenches and a clean pocket makes an average QB look good. I think that his Cowherd's way of thinking but I could be wrong.

345,Keys to the Season: Broncos,"Did you guys miss me? Our router died so the internet was out for a while, but now things are back on track.

Heading into a new season there's always players that change teams and new blood that gets drafted. All of them have a chance to improve, or destroy a team's season. Let's look at what each team did in the offseason, moving on to the Broncos.

Losses:

Case Keenum is gone. The Broncos put their faith in him last year only because he was the only option left and the results were exactly what they expected. As has been the case in Broncos country ever sine Peyton retired, and a bit before hat even, the qb has under-performed.

Center Matt Paradis was great for the Broncos before his surgery in 2017. Afterward, not so much. He got injured again the following year. It sucks to lose a guy who was one of the best, but when he's no longer one of the best it's much easier to move on.

The O-line actually lost quite a few pieces but none of them were really that good so moving on should be easy.

Adam Jones was a big name once upon a time, but hasn't done much on the field for two seasons now. The Broncos barely had him to begin with so they won't really miss him.

One guy they will miss is Bradley Roby. He's not a great cornerback per se, but he does a solid job.

Gains:

Joe Flacco has been brought in to be the new quarterback and while this isn't exactly the Manning signing it's still an improvement on Case Keenum. Flacco's not a great quarterback, but he's good enough.

Drew Lock was also drafted, but doesn't have much chance of starting this year. Thankfully Fangio is being honest with us about where Lock is. Maybe he'll end up being the future, but this season he's irrelevant.

At offensive tackle the Broncos signed Ja'Wuan James who should be an immediate upgrade and at offensive guard they drafted Dalton Risner who should also be an upgrade.

Most importantly for the offensive line though is the new offensive line coach Mike Munchak. For those who don't know that's the guy who made the Steelers offensive line the powerful unit it's been for the past few years. I'm not saying the Broncos O-Line will be that good this season, but the improvement should be obvious.

Dre'Mont Jones is still behind Derek Wolfe on the depth chart which wouldn't have been a big deal in 2016 when Wolfe was good, but at this point he has to resort to bashing people who are trying to improve things to stay relevant.

To help a weak receiving unit Noah Fant was brought in with hopes being that he was the next George Kittle. So far though he's been more pre-Colts Eric Ebron having a serious case of the dropsies. If he gets that fixed he should do well, but for now he sits as either the second or third tight end depending on how the Broncos organize their depth chart. In retrospect the second best tight end on Iowa's team probably wasn't the best option in the first round.

At cornerback the Texans and Broncos apparently decided to swap cornerbacks. The Broncos appear to have gotten the short side of the stick as Kareem Jackson never fully had the Texans' trust. Still, it shouldn't be too big of a loss. The Broncos also did what the Texans said they would do and made him a safety.

He doesn't have to replace Roby on his own though because the Broncos also brought in Bryce Callahan from the Bears. Bryce is a gamble though, last season he was the seventh best cornerback in the league. he did barely anything every year before that. If he works out this secondary is going to be terrifying.

Also your new head coach/defensive coordinator is the guy who was with Bryce the whole way. Vic Fangio is responsible for making the Bears defense a powerful unit and taking it to new levels last year. Widely seen as great with linebackers he should be able to help the struggles at coverage linebacker and could make the entire defense nearly as good as the Bears were last year.

Overall:

Joe Flacco is better than Case Keenum. The Broncos qb situation is fine.

The offensive line was going to see improvements before Ju'Wuan James and Dalton Risner were brought in. It could be a legitimately strong unit which in turn should boost the entire offense.

The defense as a whole should be boosted by Vic Fangio. Personnel wise the defensive line is mostly the same, which isn't a bad thing when you have guys like Bradley Chubb and Von Miller.

Tight end didn't lose anything so Noah Fant is just another chance for success even if he does have problems that need to be fixed.

And while Bryce Callahan is a bit of a gamble having his old coach should help it pay off and turn this secondary into a bigger powerhouse than it was.

The X Factor: The Receivers.

Great defense. Good quarterback. Good O-Line. Good running-back.

The only thing missing is a good receiving core. They're the only thing stopping me from making the Broncos Super Bowl favorites.  If Emmanuel Sanders continues to be decent, Courtland Sutton improves on last year's impressive rookie performance, and Noah Fant cures himself of the dropsies there's really no reason not to hand these guys the Lombardi.",nfl,BolbyB,11,2019-08-17

**[THE HUB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AyxpJkjnV6bg2mwnlvlaeI-TW13CSYqURmFB6JGOJm8/edit?usp=sharing)**

Yesterday was the busiest day yet when it came to the voting. And after yesterday’s chain of events, we have reached the Final Four. Just four teams are left in determining the greatest 7-on-7 team of all-time, assuming that each team can only use one player per draft round. Some of the results to get to this point have been somewhat surprising, including arguably the favorite in the tournament going down at the hands of a #12 seed.

But over the weekend, we’re going to settle this once and for all and put a wrap on this series. Today, we’ve got Final Four voting. Tomorrow, we’ll do the championship voting. And on Monday, the winner will officially be announced. Get your popcorn ready for what’s going to be an exciting weekend.

**Yesterday’s Results (89 votes)**

- **Buffalo Bills (64%)** defeat **New England Patriots (36%)**

- **Pittsburgh Steelers (59.6%)** defeat **Kansas City Chiefs (40.4%)**

- **New York Giants (55.1%)** defeat **Dallas Cowboys (44.9%)**

- **San Francisco 49ers (52.8%)** defeat **Chicago Bears (47.2%)**

Remember that for this tournament, the teams are playing on a smaller field more suited for 7-on-7 (so players can’t just run around each other on an NFL-sized field). Special teams are excluded. All you have to do is vote on the Google form for each matchup. To make it easy, much like I did with the [/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c7s9ez/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_series_finale/?st=jz9fn54r&amp;sh=6f6d5a30), the teams will be listed in the form so you don’t have to hop back and forth between tabs.

The teams are seeded based on their lifetime winning percentage. And, the bracket and every team is listed in the hub, which is at the top of the post. I updated the bracket to include the logos of each of the Final Four teams, so go and check that out.

For instance I like what the Colts have been doing recently, but for the love of God just tell me how Luck is!

When he had that shoulder tear they said he'd be back for week one, then sometime in the season, then he definitely wasn't coming back that year at all.

This year his injury was nothing. Then it moved to a different part of his body and became a small something. Now he's questionable for week one.

Either Indy needs a new medical staff or they continuously lie to us about how Luck's doing.

I love what the Colts are doing. The defense has hope for once. Our owner shows his real self, for better and worse.

406,Am I crazy for thinking Daniel Jones isn't that big of a bust?,Obviously he's the bust of the draft but people act like he's the biggest bust in NFL history. I agree he should've been a 3rd or 4th round pick but I'd argue the giants could've done worse. Giants will probably draft a QB next season considering how deep the talent pool is in college football this season,nfl,knicksworld,38,2019-08-17
407,What team are you secretly rooting for this year?,"I was listening to Pat McAfee's podcast the other day, where TY Hilton remarked that this is the humblest team he's ever been on in the NFL. From my vantage point, it seems like the Colts have established a really good culture from the top down. I always love seeing teams like this succeed.

What team will you be pulling for this season in a similar way?

To be clear, I don't think a person should have more than one favorite team. But some teams are just so easy and natural to root for.",nfl,ChocolateMonkeyBird,84,2019-08-17

437,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 82)","""The Dynasty Begins...""

To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 82: 2001 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 9, 2001-February 3, 2002

Teams: 31

2001 NFL Draft: 246 selections (7 rounds), held in New York City, NY.

2001 First Draft Pick: Michael Vick, Quarterback from Virginia Tech University (Atlanta Falcons)

2001 AP Most Valuable Player: Kurt Warner, Quarterback (St. Louis Rams)

Super Bowl XXXVI: New England Patriots (AFC) defeated St. Louis Rams (NFC) 20-17 at Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, LA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-Fumble recoveries will be awarded at the spot of the recovery, not where the player’s momentum carries him. This change was passed in response to two regular season games in 2000, Falcons/Panthers and Raiders/Seahawks in which a safety was awarded when a defensive player’s momentum in recovering a fumble carried him into his own end zone.

\-Taunting rules and roughing the passer will be strictly enforced.

Following a pattern set in 1999, the first week of the season was permanently moved to the weekend following Labor Day. With Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVII already scheduled for fixed dates, the league initially decided to eliminate the Super Bowl bye weeks for 2001 and 2002 to adjust.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the games originally scheduled for September 16 and 17 were postponed and rescheduled to the weekend of January 6 and 7. In order to retain the full playoff format, all playoff games, including the Super Bowl, were rescheduled one week later. The season-ending Pro Bowl was also moved to one week later. This was the last season in which each conference had three divisions, as the conferences would be realigned to four divisions for the 2002 NFL season.

Starting in 1990, the league added 2 additional playoff teams to round out the playoff field to 12 teams (6 from each conference). From 1990 to the end of the 2001 season, there were 3 division winners per conference as well as 3 wild cards. The top 2 division winners would have a bye week to the divisional round, while the others played on wild card weekend. Since 1990, the league altered the rules of division opponents facing off in the divisional round of the playoffs, there was ban on that until 1990, but now division opponents can meet any weekend of the post-season (except the Super Bowl). The highest seeds remaining after the divisional round would host the conference title games.

The playoff qualifiers were:

|*AFC*|*Seed*|*NFC*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Pittsburgh Steelers (13-3) \[Central\]|*#1*|St. Louis Rams (14-2) \[West\]|
|New England Patriots (11-5) \[East\]|*#2*|Chicago Bears (13-3) \[Central\]|
|Oakland Raiders (10-6) \[West\]|*#3*|Philadelphia Eagles (11-5) \[East\]|
|Miami Dolphins (11-5) \[Wild Card\]|*#4*|Green Bay Packers (12-4) \[Wild Card\]|

**Super Bowl XXXVI**

The New England Patriots and St. Louis Rams competed in Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, LA. The attendance was 72,922 while Fox handled the broadcast duties. The Rams were favored by 14 points.

The Rams scored first midway through the first quarter, with quarterback Kurt Warner completing 6-of-7 passes for 43 yards on a 48-yard, 10-play drive to set up a 50-yard field goal by kicker Jeff Wilkins. At the time, the field goal was the third longest in Super Bowl history. While the rest of the quarter was scoreless, the Patriots were stifling the typically high powered Rams offense by playing physical man coverage with the Rams receivers, forcing them into long drives that would end in punts or field goal attempts.

Early in the second quarter, the Rams drove to New England's 34-yard line, but Warner threw an incompletion on third down, and Wilkins' subsequent 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.

With 8:49 left in the second quarter, a blitz by linebacker Mike Vrabel led Warner to be intercepted by Patriots defensive back Ty Law on a pass that was intended for wide receiver Isaac Bruce, Law then scored on a 47-yard return to give the Patriots a 7–3 lead. With less than two minutes left in the first half, Warner completed a pass to receiver Ricky Proehl at the Rams 40-yard line, but New England defensive back Antwan Harris tackled him, and forced a fumble which was recovered by Patriots defensive back Terrell Buckley. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady started off the Patriots drive with a 16-yard completion to Troy Brown and finished it with an 8-yard touchdown pass to receiver David Patten with 31 seconds left in the half. By halftime, New England owned a surprising 14–3 lead. It was the first time in the entire 2001 season that the Rams fell behind by more than eight points in a game.

The Patriots received the opening kickoff of the second half, but could only reach the St. Louis 43-yard line before being forced to punt. Aided by a 20-yard reception by wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim, a 22-yard reception by Bruce, and a defensive pass interference penalty on Patriots defensive back Otis Smith, the Rams advanced to the New England 41-yard line. However, on the next play, Vrabel and defensive lineman Richard Seymour sacked Warner for a 9-yard loss. Warner then threw two consecutive incomplete passes, which resulted in the Rams punting.

Later in the third quarter, Smith intercepted a pass intended for Rams wide receiver Torry Holt after Holt slipped while coming off the line of scrimmage, and returned the ball 30 yards to the Rams 33-yard line. Though St. Louis' defense did not give up a touchdown to the Patriots, kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 37-yard field goal to increase New England's lead to 17–3.

The Rams responded by driving to the Patriots' 3-yard line on their ensuing drive. On fourth-and-goal, the Rams attempted to score a touchdown. Warner went back to pass and finding no one open scrambled to his right trying to run the ball in for a touchdown. Warner fumbled the ball while being tackled by linebacker Roman Phifer, which was recovered by defensive back Tebucky Jones who returned it 97 yards for a touchdown that would have increased the Patriots lead to 23–3. However, the play was nullified by a holding penalty on linebacker Willie McGinest, who illegally hugged Rams running back Marshall Faulk and prevented him from becoming an eligible receiver. This gave the Rams a first down on the 1-yard line. On second down, Warner scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to cut the Patriots' lead to 17–10.

After Warner's touchdown, the Rams defense forced the Patriots to a three-and-out. St. Louis then drove from own 7-yard line to the New England 36-yard line, aided by a 30-yard reception by Proehl. However, McGinest sacked Warner for a 16-yard loss on second down, pushing the Rams back to their 46-yard line. St. Louis punted after Warner's third down pass was incomplete.

The Rams forced New England to another three-and-out, and got the ball back on their own 45-yard line with 1:51 left in the game. Warner threw three consecutive completions: an 18-yard pass to Hakim, an 11-yard one to wide receiver Yo Murphy, and finally a 26-yard touchdown completion to Proehl that tied the game 17–17 with 1:30 left in the fourth quarter.

The Patriots had no timeouts left for their ensuing drive, which led Fox color commentator John Madden to initially suggest that the Patriots should run out the clock and attempt to win in overtime. Instead, New England attempted to get the winning score in regulation on the final drive. Bill Belichick conferred with offensive coordinator Charlie Weis and they agreed to go for it. Belichick later stated, ""With a quarterback like Brady, going for the win is not that dangerous, because he's not going to make a mistake."" Brady opened the drive with three dump-off completions to running back J. R. Redmond, who got out of bounds on the last one and moved the ball to their 41-yard line with 33 seconds left. At this point, Madden admitted on the air that he now liked what the Patriots were doing. After an incomplete pass, Brady completed a 23-yard pass underneath the Rams' zone defense to wide receiver Troy Brown—who also got out of bounds—and followed it up with a 6-yard completion to tight end Jermaine Wiggins to advance to the Rams' 30-yard line. Brady then spiked the ball with seven seconds left, which set up Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal attempt. Vinatieri's game-winning kick was successful, marking the first time in Super Bowl history that a game was won by a score on the final play.

The win gave the New England Patriots their first Super Bowl title after 2 previous Super Bowl defeats. This marked the start of the ""Patriots Dynasty"" that has continued to this very day. The Patriots competed in an additional 8 Super Bowls since, winning 5 of them (XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII), they have not had a losing season since winning Super Bowl XXXVI, and have set numerous league records in wins per season (including the first and so far only team to go 16-0 in a regular season), division titles, conference title game appearances, and overall wins by a single quarterback. The St. Louis Rams would not return to the Super Bowl until LIII after they relocated back to Los Angeles, where they would lose once again to the New England Patriots.

2,I really don’t understand awarding un-used timeouts from the first half into the second half is a bad idea.,"First, for the people who say teams would never call time outs in the first half don’t know football that well. 

What if your team gets the ball with a minute left and good field position, those time outs are gonna come in handy because you’re gonna need to work the middle of the field in order to move the ball unless you’re Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees or Tom Brady. So there’s one reason to use timeouts in the first half. 

Also, what if your defense is confused before a play or if you have 12 men on the field or if you’re about to get a delay of game penalty that could kill your drive? Of corse you would call time out unless you’re an incompetent coach. 

Second, for the people who say it would make the end of games longer...Ok hypothetically you could have 12 timeouts left in the 4th quarter which is still pretty unlikely, you’re adding maybe an extra 10 minutes to the game that would have been included in the game anyway. 

You’re telling me you can’t wait an extra 10 minutes at the end of a game???, cmon now.",nfl,shittersfull244,26,2019-08-01

6,Matt Ryan had virtually better stats in every category in 2018. Aaron Rodgers landed 61 spots ahead of him on the NFL's top 100 list.,"Matt Ryan's 2018 stats: Cmp%: 69.4 Yards: 4924 Y/A: 8.1 TD: 35 Int: 7

Aaron Rodgers 2018 stats: Cmp%: 62.3 Yards: 4442 Y/A: 7.4 TD: 25 Int: 2

Rodgers only had 5 less int's than Ryan, and that is the only stat he is beating him in.

I am by no means a Matt Ryan fan, I just didnt think Rodgers had that amazing of a year to land him the number 8 spot in the league. Just shows the NFL's bias toward Aaron Rodgers

13,Greatest runners of these guys? (Endgame spoilers sort kf),"Ok so your choices are:

- Jeremy renner or whoever ninja guy he was but this is like nominating fat rob and is a meme choice because they tried so hard to make him endearing and significant and he’s just not 

- prince tchalla, very physical runner with tremendous athletic ability. Total package with quicks, fantastic vision and 99 awareness

- Spider-Boy, wrap his legs up and he goes down unless he has a hell of a lead blocker. Even then he has no head for the game and not sure his demeanor fits...silky 10000 thread count soft too

- thanos, og he’s te all time yards leader and I’m pretty sure he’s juicing. But kinda like Steven Jackson without the chop, thanos just kept playing on shitty teams and couldn’t win it all at the end. I could also see a t rich comp because he got all the ability in the universe but just doenst have the vision baby look at his eyes 

- super duper girl, I mean she’s tremendously powerful with a notch below home run speed but when you run behind that OL you’re kinda like that Steelers 2k yards guy. Some say she’s the best but you just can’t know with such a dominant trench squad

- Tony Stark, HELLOW MIKE TOLBERT PLEASE COME ON DOWN. The culture of vultures and not startingback material but when you’re near the paint then you give it to 11 and watch him shake and bake. He’s 100% heart and 900% soul tho so you need him the Locke room and he will Put his life on the line for the good of the team. A winner in all regards

Division: AFC South
10-6 (4-2)

#Intro

Last season, the Colts *blew* expectations out of the water. After being called a potential 1st overall pick team, because who knew if Andrew Luck would ever play again, the Colts came roaring back, carried early in the season by their defense (a sentence I never expected to be able to write), until Luck got reacclimated enough to lead the team again. While the season ended with a disappointing playoff loss to Kansas City, it was still far above the expectations for a team full of so many rookies and new free agents.This year, they’re actually primed for success.

#Coaching Changes:

There was really only one major coaching change this year. The entire Offensive Line coaching staff was overhauled. Former Patriots OL Coach Dave DeGuglielmo was hired by Josh McDaniels before he quit his job. He was let go after this season because of a “difference in coaching philosophies”. The current theory is that Guges handled Denzelle Good’s family tragedy in a way Reich didn’t like. (For those out of the loop, Good’s brother was murdered in a drive-by shooting, so Good took some time off for bereavement. DeGuglielmo didn’t like that his head wasn’t in the game three weeks later, so Good was cut, in what seemed to be a mutual parting of ways.) Assistent OL Coach Bobby Johnson was snatched up by the Bills to coach their OL. So that’ll hurt, but I think we’ll be alright. Mostly because they found the great **Howard Mudd** to return as a “senior offensive assistant”. Mudd coached the golden-age Colts Offensive lines with Jeff Saturday, Tarik Glenn, and Ryan Diem, among others. That line was rock solid and let Peyton Manning take as long as he needed to throw. How did they get Mudd back? They brought in **Chris Strausser** to coach the offensive line. Strausser is coming from coaching offensive lines in the Pac 12 and developed a strong bond with Mudd. They came as a sort of package deal. **Klayton Adams** came in to replace Johnson as the OL assistant. That coaching change went from being a scary warning to an absolute **A+++** hire. This was beyond our wildest dreams. We also brought in a new Tight Ends coach **Jason Michael**, who has spent time coaching such individuals as Antonio Gates and as offensive coordinator in Tennessee.

#Free Agency:

Losses:
Name | Position | New Team
:-- | :-- | :--
Dontrelle Inman | WR | Patriots
Al Woods | DT | Seahawks
Ryan Grant | WR | Raiders
Najee Goode | LB | Jaguars

Yeah, we didn’t really lose much. Inman is the only one that was a contributor on the team by week 10. Everyone else had been pretty well phased out. Woods was the best big man on the DL we had, but it seems that the defensive philosophy is going to emphasize speed. Honestly, these are the biggest losses and none of these are going to hurt.

Pickups:
Name | Position | Old Team | Length | Money
:--|:--|:--
Spencer Ware | RB | Chiefs | 1 Yr | 1.2 Mil
Justin Houston | DE | Chiefs | 2 Yr | 23 Mil
Devin Funchess | WR | Panthers | 1 Yr | 10 Mil

Most of the free agents that actually got signed played for the Colts last year, like Vinatieri, Desir, and Moore. These three are the only three free agents that stand any sort of chance of making the roster next year. Houston is immediately the best pass rusher on the defense. Funchess, even with his problems from his time in Carolina, is immediately the second best WR that has actually played in the NFL. Ware is serious competition for the RB position. If four get carried, it’ll be amazing. If only three make the team, a good one will be getting cut. But the Colts were not *nearly* as active in free agency as some people expected. If anyone actually bothered to listen to Chris Ballard, this wouldn’t be a surprise, though.

#Draft:

Round | Pick | Name | Position | College
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
2 | 34 | Rock Ya-Sin | CB | Temple
2 | 49 | Ben Banogu | OLB | TCU
2 | 59 | Parris Campbell | WR | Ohio State
3 | 89 | Bobby Okereke | LB | Stanford
4 | 109| Khari Willis | SS | Michigan State
5 | 144 | Marvel Tell | CB | USC
5 | 164 | EJ Speed | LB | Tarleton State
6 | 199 | Gerri Green | DE | Mississippi State
7 | 240 | Jackson Barton | OT | Utah
7 | 248 | Javon Patterson | OL | Mississippi

Last year, the Colts got one of the best grades on their draft by the end of the season. Shoutout to Andy Benoit for calling the Quenton Nelson pick a D+ because ""there were bigger needs on defense"". This year, the Colts were returning 21/22 starters. Instead of needing depserately to find players that can be on the field for 70-80% of snaps, they were finally able to step back and not demand all their draft picks be day one ROY canditates. Most of these picks were made not with this season in mind, but with the next two to three years. On the whole, I’d give this draft class about a **B** average. There’s some great potential in these players, but at least three wouldn’t make the 53 man roster their first season.

**Trades**

The Colts traded back out of the first round to pick up some second round picks this year and next. This really makes sense, because the FO thought there were enough guys they wanted left on the board, and they'd be able to get the value out of the second rounds. It also shows an interesting approach to the draft. Rather than tier players by round, the Colts front office simply breaks players into tiers, and if there are enough remaining, they'll built up as much capital as possible.

**Rock Ya-Sin, CB, Temple**

2.34 (2nd in Round)

After a stronger-than-expected showing from the defense last season, the secondary still appeared as a glaring weakness. While Desir had some flashes (shutting down Hopkins), Wilson was still disappointing and Moore was excelling in the slot, but not nearly as great on the outside. Ya-Sin provides a powerful leadership ability and a wilingness to help out in run support. His athleticism has also been on full display so far this offseason, and he finished a practice last week with two interceptions. Arrow pointing up, and the depth in the roster means he won't be thrown to the wolves his first week unless he's actually earned it. I'm still not sure how I feel about Rock as a player, but this one totally makes sense to me. **A-**

**Ben Banogu, DE, TCU**

2.49 (17th in Round)

At first glance, Banogu doesn't realy make a ton of sense. After all, this roster already had Sheard, Houston, and Kemoko Turay from last year, in addition to Muhammad, Lewis, and Ward, who all spent time on the edge too. Banogu wasn't one of those premier players in the pre-draft chatter, but looking back at it, I'm actually a little confused as to why. He's got some great explosiveness, and most importantly, he has some experience (albeit in high school) playing LB. To simplify for him this year, he's going to be focusing primarily on rushing the passer. But the long term plan is for ihm to play either some SAM or bring back the LEO/Joker role in the defense that hasn't been seen since Tony Dungy used Raheem Brock. Freakishly athletic, but with time to grow and learn the position. This is definitely a long-term pick. **B+**

**Parris Campbell, WR, Ohio State**

2.59 (27th in round)

We knew Parris Campbell had some freakish speed. We knew he had some crazy YAC ability. We also knew the Colts had one of the worst YACs in the league last year and nothing in the WR group behind TY Hilton. Match made in heaven, right? Frank Reich apparently pounded the table for this pick, going so far as to say ""it's not fair"" that this offense gets him along with TY, Mack, Ware, Hines, Ebron, Doyle, and Alie-Cox. That's a lot of possibilities for the offense to use. While it seemed like a luxury pick at the time, it's another subtle long-term pick. TY has been playing for 8 years and specializes in speed and crisp routes. That's not a recipe for a super long career for a WR. And aside from the question marks of Deon Cain and what may be, there's nobody on this roster that the coaching staff was super excited to see in three years. Campbell is going to be a big part of this for years to come. **A**

**Bobby Okereke, LB, Stanford**

3.89 (25th in round)

LB doesn't seem to be much of a need for the Colts, right? After all, Leonard just won DROY, Walker had a quiet breakout season, and we just drafted Banogu to play SAM. But low-key, the Colts LB depth last year was... not good. It also helps that Okereke is a very similar prospect to Leonard, at least from a measurement standpoint. Speed, length, and instincts are all there, he just needs training. It's a good thing he'll be able to sit behind one of the best young LBs in the league. Okereke figures to be a rotational MLB with Anthony Walker. While Walker is the expected starter, I fully expect to see Okereke start to push him for playing time by the end of this season. This move also gives the Colts infinitely more LB depth than they had last season, when the backups included Najee Goode and Zaire Franklin. He also brings the athleticism to be able to play any LB position, and in a world with a limited roster size, positional flexibility is at a premium. **B**

**Khari Willis, S, Michigan State**

4.109 (7th in round)

This offseason, you probably heard a lot of Colts fans clamoring for someone like Nasir Adderly because while Malik Hooker can shut down half the field, the other side of the safety room is... we'll be nice and say ""injury-prone"". Geathers hasn't played a full season since being drafted and Farley, while a solid backup, doesn't quite have the instincts needed to be a solid SS. Enter Willis, the keynote speaker for the Big 10's awards banquet. He's got the work ethic to learn every part of the position and the range to work with Hooker deep. With Farley and Geathers both on one year deals, Willis is another one looking to sit this year and start next year. He won't provide the greatest upside, but a solid, consistent player is still something this team needs. **B-**

**Marvell Tell, CB, University of Southern California**

5.144 (6th in round)

Tell is an interesting prospect. His athletic testing was really good, but he played as a S in college. Last season, the depth in the CB room was lacking to say the least. The great Lenzy Pipkins actually saw the field, on multiple occasions. It's clear that they want to avoid that same thing this year. While Ya-Sin is going to be pushing for starting duties this year, Tell is definitely someone they see as a raw pure athlete that they can teach to be a CB. As far as immediate impact goes, I expect Tell to make the roster for special teams abilities, but I don't think it's impossible for him to spend this year on the practice squad learning the role. Hopefully this depth experiment works out. **C**

**EJ Speed, LB, Tarleton State**

5.164 (26th in round)

A small school LB with ridiculous length and great athletic testing... sounds familiar, right? He's a very physical defender, and on tape, it looks like he actually enjoys hitting guys. He struggles when he gets caught by OL, but definitely looks like he'll be a day one special teams contributor, if that athleticism is any indicator. But Speed is still a very raw LB right now and will definitely need time to sit and learn the position. It's a good thing the WILL in front of him is another small school prospect that everyone had questions about coming into the league, isn't it? The LB group now has plenty of depth. **B**

**Gerri Green, DE, Mississippi State**

6.199 (26th in round)

Green is... interesting. He was definitely not the best player on that Mississippi State defense, but he was a captain. He was brought in primarily for his leadership ability, as far as I can tell. He'll be pushing for a roster spot and lucky to get one with how deep the DL looks and Banogu making the transition to mostly playing DE. Huge dude, great athleticism, but limited college production and the depth of the DL group in front of him mean that Green will probably spend his first NFL season on the practice squad. **B-**

**Jackson Barton, OT, Utah**

7.240 (26th in round)

A tall LT with some speed. He struggle setting his base but once he gets set, has some serious strength. For as good as the first team is, our OL needs a *lot* of help with depth. There's only two guys I'd be at all comfortable with having to come into a game. Barton actually reminds me a little bit of Zach Banner, the giant bear of a man Ballard drafted in 2017 in the 4th round. I think Barton has great athleticism, but needs a lot of work to be able to be a consistent OT in the NFL. But, it's a 7th round player. You get what you pay for. **B+**

**Javon Patterson, C, Ole Miss**

7.246 (32nd in round)

Patterson is pretty good at being able to be a wall, but doesn't quite have the strength to push around the stronger DL players. He strikes me as somewhat similar to Boehm, a solid player that has good technique when in his spot on the line, but doesn't really have the speed or athleticism to work on the second level. Another depth pick that will hopefully be developing on the practice squad. Unfortunately, Patterson tore his ACL in the spring and will miss the entire season. **C**

#Roster

QB: 2
**Luck**, Brissett

Yeah, the Colts went ahead and signed $wag Kelly and brought back Philip Walker, the on-again-off-again practice squad QB that they've been using to sort of hold 11 practice squad players. But none of them stand a chance to beat out Luck (obviously), a top 10 QB in the league, or Brissett, the guy who started for him for a year and is probably better than a handful of starters out there. This position is set for good, though this is a contract year for Brissett, so questions abound about next year.

RB: 4
**Mack**, Hines, Wilkins, Ware

This is my first controversial lineup. I don't know if the Colts will actually carry 4 RBs this year. They did at times last year, but it was usually with someone injured. Mack is the incumbent feature back and Hines is one of those gadget players that OCs love to play with (and there will be more on this roster). Wilkins is the one that replaced Mack while he was suspended to start last season and showed some promise, although he struggled with fumbles. Ware is really the big name here. After starting for KC in 2016, he's now with the Colts to provide some serious competition at the RB stable. I don't think it's impossible for him to beat out Mack for the feature back job, or even bump Wilkins off the roster entirely. But for now, I've got him as a backup, one of 4 RBs.

WR: 5
**Hilton**, **Funchess**, Campbell, Cain, Pascal

This is another one where I'm sure there will be some controversy. TY is obviously top of the depth chart, and that's not changing. I've got Funchess as the second at the moment because he seems to be the best compliment to TY with his size, but that could change. With how much they're paying him, I fully expect him to make the roster. Parris Campbell was a second round pick and another one of those gadget players, specializing on jet sweeps and breaking small plays to the house. Deon Cain was the very exciting rookie sixth round pick last year from Clemson who tore his ACL in the first preseason game, but displayed some fantastic athleticism and big play ability. The coaching staff is incredibly high on Cain. I have Pascal as the fifth over people like Chester Rogers, Penny Hart, and Marcus Johnson quite frankly because Pascal is the best blocking WR the Colts have had for a while. He also has experience with returning, and while Rogers has it too, Pascal is a much better blocker and doesn't have the unfortunate tendency to try to run a punt out of the end zone for seven to twelve yards. Hart could be one of those UDFAs that make the roster (another gadget type player).

TE: 4
**Jack Doyle**, **Eric Ebron**, Mo Alie-Cox, Ross Travis

The Colts have the best TE room in the league. They may not have the best TE, and there may be a tandem or two out there better than their top two, but nobody even comes close to having a third and fourth TE as good as the Colts. Doyle is back after a bad kidney injury, the keystone blocking and catching machine who has served as Luck's favorite target when the WR cupboard was bare. Ebron obviously had a huge breakout year last year with his 15 TDs, but don't expect a repeat of that. He's no longer the only red zone threat and his limited blocking actually saw him lose a large number of snaps to Mo Alie-Cox last year. Mo is the guy who Moss'd the Raiders for a beautiful TD that mirrored one of his signature VCU dunks. Oh, by the way, Mo Cox played basketball. He's been progressing beautifully into a well-rounded TE. Ross Travis is the next TE that they've been working on developing, another former basketball player with some great athleticism. He’s apparently been getting pushed by Hale Hentges, but I think Hale ends up on the PS.

OL: 10
**Castonzo**, **Nelson**, **Kelly**, **Glowinski**, **Smith**, Haeg, Clark, Boehm, Barton, Andrews

The starting five on this group is set. They were far and away one of the best in the league last year, going a whopping 5 games without allowing a single sack. Castonzo is definitely the oldest one, entering a contract year. Nelson is coming off an all-pro rookie season and entered training camp talking about everything he wasn't happy with last season. Kelly is actually probably the biggest question mark here. He's been a good to great C, but had some major problems with injuries the past couple seasons. He's still on a rookie contract, though, so he's not going anywhere. Glowinski is example number one of the difference Tom Cable makes. He's the weakest link on this line, but he was also a stud, just like the rest of them last season, stepping in when Matt Slauson broke his back. Braden Smith was probably the biggest surprise of the bunch last year, though. Stepping in at T after being drafted as a guard, Smith immediately jumped into the role, not giving up his spot for the rest of the season. Haeg and Clark are both very solid backups, Haeg able to play any position on the line (literally, he's taken a snap at all 5) and Clark a serviceable tackle. This position probably has the least depth of any on the roster. There's a significant drop between the first and second string guys. Boehm was an amazing replacement for Kelly last year, earning a higher PFF grade, but he has a humongous weakness when he's asked to actually get to the second level, which limits his ability. Barton is a rookie taken in the 7th round this year along with Patterson, who tore his ACL and is out the season. Poehls is the 10th man, literally because they need more G depth. I have no clue who number 10 on this group will be, and not because of the level of competition.

DL: 10
**Sheard**, **Hunt**, **Autry**, **Houston**, Turay, Lewis, Banogu, Ward, Stewart, Muhammad

This is a strange group. Reich and Ballard have both said they really envision all four positions on the DL as one-gap penetrators, and the way they've positioned the roster makeup, they seem to be moving away from ""traditional"" DT/DE differences. Hunt, Autry, Turay, Lewis, and Ward can play inside or outside, and the team made some pretty liberal use of stunts to get some pass rush last season. Sheard is the unsung hero of this defense, by far the best pass rusher for the last two years. This is the final year of his contract, but he's performed exemplary up to this point. However, a training camp injury means he may miss the first week or two of the regular season. Hunt had himself on pace for a breakout season before an injury slowed him down, and he never really fully recovered before the season ended. Autry broke out in a big way, finding a way to not just generate sacks, but also block punts. Justin Houston is the new big name, added as both a mentor and because Ballard and co. believe that he still has plenty of rush left in him, if he's in the right system (and this is). Kemoko Turay started last year pretty hot, but found himself in the doghouse a little bit after showing a seeming lack of effort at times. Another season to grow and mature, along with more time in practice could help him replace Sheard next season. Lewis was the IR-return last year, and when he returned, he made a decent splash. He's got a remarkably similar style to Autry, and I think having Autry to mentor him is paying off in a big way. Stewart is the only big body left on the roster, so I'm kinda guessing he'll make the roster for that alone. Ben Banogu was drafted to be a Sam linebacker, but he showed enough rush that they have him as purely a DE right now. I think he might end up spending time as a LB in the middle of the season, which is why I've got 10 DL instead of 9. Jihad Ward showed up in a big way last season until an injury sent him to IR. Al-Quadin Muhammad seems to be the only player capable of taking over for an injured Sheard.

LB: 5
**Leonard**, **Walker**, Okereke, Speed, Adams

Darius Leonard is the most obvious on defense. The other rookie all-pro (suck it Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers, not the only ones anymore), Leonard came into training camp just ""trying to earn a starting job"". Safe to say I think he's got it. He's looking to improve over his unbelievable rookie season, trying to climb into that tier with Luke Kuechly and Bobby Wagner. Anthony Walker is the incumbent Mike and a brilliant middle linebacker, but lacks a little bit of speed on passing downs. That's where Okereke comes in, in the tightest battle in the defense front 7. My guess is they'll be splitting snaps 60-40 by week 3. EJ Speed is one of those guys that can play any LB position, and I have a feeling he'll be used in all of them. Newly drafted rookie, Speed popped on the radar with his amazing athletic testing at his pro day. Matthew Adams was the starting Sam for the second half of the season, and with Banogu making the transition to more of a DE, I don't think anyone is going to beat him out for that. I know a lot of teams will carry 6 LBs, but I think the Colts will only carry 5. SAM is their least used LB position, and he’s only on the field for 15-20 snaps a game at most.

CB: 6
**Desir**, **Moore**, **Wilson**, Ya-Sin, Collins, Tell

This is the hardest position on the roster to project. There are 8 guys that could make the roster and surprise no one, and just about any of them could start. I've got Nate Hairston and Chris Milton as the last two bumped here, both will probably end up on other rosters. If Hairston does make the roster, Tell will find himself on the practice squad, because that athletic testing is going to be kept close to home. He's being transformed from a S to a CB, so I don't think he's starting, even if he makes the roster. However, he’s apparently been making some huge plays in special teams practice, so I think he’ll be able to get to the final 53 on that alone. Desir made a name for himself last season in particular after showing up in a big way to shut down Hopkins in the playoffs. Kenny Moore II is the highest paid slot corner in the league. He also has figured out the art of a slot blitz and covering slot receivers. He's good at what he does. Quincy Wilson has been quite the anomaly. Some days he'll show up in a big way, others he barely even sees the field. It sounds like he's been struggling with effort, but last year, he got some mentoring in the form of some senior players. I think he'll show up with the effort and knowledge to finally solidify himself as a starter. Rock Ya-Sin was the first second round pick this year. His toughness and skill at Temple earned him a single digit jersey and the staff was raving about him after the spring trainings. Jalen Collins is the last guy I have making the roster. He's been practicing with the 1s, and I think he's going to make the roster, but starting is going to be interesting and depend on who the coaching staff trusts more. Another close one to watch.

S: 4
**Hooker**, **Geathers**, Farley, Willis

Another controversial one. Hooker is absolutely the starter. He basically shut down half the field last season after a short rookie season that saw him land 3 interceptions in 6 games, before tearing his ACL in the 7th. Geathers is injury prone, but when he's there, he's another strong SS. Farley may beat him out for that starting job, but I think they prefer using him as a 3rd safety when needed. Willis was another newly drafted rookie, who stood out especially for his leadership, giving the keynote address at the Big 10 banquet last year. George Odum is the one that I don't have making it that's most controversial, but I think he gets bumped by Willis.

ST: 3
**Vinatieri**, **Sanchez**, **Rhodes**

Adam Vinatieri is the all-time scoring champion, back to continue to extend his lead. He didn't look great in KC last year, but until that game, he was looking absolutely fine. Sanchez is low-key a top 5 punter in the league. He doesn't always have the deepest punts, but his hangtimes are absolutely killer. He's got a shockingly low return allowed per punt number, with a 45.3 yards per punt and 42.7 net. Rhodes continues to serve as long snapper and backup LB, and he hikes the ball good.
 

2019 Schedule: (9-7, 4-2)

Yes, I realize this is actually a step down from last year. The Colts have a crazy difficult schedule (at least, on paper right now) and I’m trying very hard not to be a blind homer.

Week 1: @ Chargers (L)

This is a real tough game to open the season on. An away game at one of the best rosters in the league, with another proven high-level QB and one of the best DLs in the league. I think the Offensive Line will be able to keep Luck upright, and I think the Chargers' weakness on the OL will prove a liability, but on the whole, I trust Rivers against the Colts' secondary more than I trust Luck against Derwin James. Game of the Week material right here, but I think the Chargers take it in a nail-biter.

Week 2: @ Titans (W)

Andrew Luck has never lost to the Tennessee Titans. The OL shut down Casey and Orakpo pretty well last year. While the Titans may have gotten better on paper, they'll be dealing with suspensions still at this point, which means the DL, though not amazing, will have an advantage. I expect a close first half, but with the Colts pulling away late in the 3rd for the win.

Week 3: vs Falcons (W)

This will be... a game. Matt Ryan vs Andrew Luck, Julio Jones vs TY Hilton. I'm expecting the Colts to win this one, and I don't expect it to be too terribly interesting. Not that it'll be a boring game, it just feels like one of those games that's going to be easily forgettable. I can't tell you why, that's just how I feel about it right now. This will be the Colts secondary's biggest test, trying to figure out how to keep Julio under control while Calvin Ridley threatens any time they let up on him. I think the score will be close, but the game won't be super interesting.

Week 4: vs Raiders (W)

Sorry, Raiders, but... I don't have faith in you. A Tom Cable coached offensive line, a lame duck QB, and an aging roster just doesn't seem like a recipe for success, and the Colts should be able to chase Carr around to their hearts' content.

Week 5: @ Chiefs (L)

A rematch of the game that ended their postseason. The real trick will be getting that offense moving this time. Having more than just a hobbled TY for offensive weapons will definitely be hugely beneficial for that, and adding Justin Houston to the Colts roster instead of the Chiefs should help to keep Luck upright. This will be another very good game, but I see the Chiefs pulling away in the 4th.

Week 6: Bye

Early bye. Not a fan.

Week 7: vs Texans (W)

The Colts were the ones that exposed the Texans the most in the postseason last year, although Hopkins was playing hurt. They did a beautiful job shutting down that Houston Defensive Line. With the home field advantage, I think the Colts take it in another close, but not that close, game. One of those where the scoreline is close, but the play really isn't.

Week 8: vs Broncos (W)

The Broncos are such a strange team right now. With Von Miller and Bradley Chubb rushing the passer in Vic Fangio's system, I expect a *strong* pass rush threat in this game. But at the same time, Joe Flacco is their starting QB. While I'm putting this in as a W right now, the Broncos could be anything any given week. We might get a scary strong defensive showing, but with the real Joe Flacco showing. Alternatively, we might get Elite QB Joe Flacco ^TM .

Week 9: @ Steelers (L)

The Steelers are another one of those strange teams. They'll lose to teams that go 3-13 or 4-12, but undefeated against playoff teams. The thing that's got me leaning towards a loss is that Andrew Luck hasn't beaten the Steelers. The average Steelersmargin of victory is... Over 30 points... So until they can prove that they've broken that curse, this one is being written in as a loss.

Week 10: vs Dolphins (W)

The Dolphins are competing for the first overall pick this year. There may be the big play or two in this game, but I don't expect this to be terribly close.

Week 11: vs Jaguars (W)

Blake Bortles is no longer leading this team. Instead, it's Nick Foles! I know he's got a lot of defenders, but I don't really believe in Foles to lead a successful full campaign season. At the same time, Jacksonville always does well against the Colts. But with home field advantage, I'm going to give Indy the edge.

Week 12: @ Texans (L)

The Colts and Texans seem to always split the series. I'm fully expecting TY to go off in a huge way at NRG Stadium (aka TY Hilton Stadium), just like he always does. He's got a career average of over 100 yards in Houston. But another close game bounces the Texans' way this time.

Week 13: vs Titans (W)

Again, Andrew Luck hasn't lost to them. I expect another win, but I think this one will be much closer than the first one. With everyone back from suspensions, it'll come down to injury luck, which the Titans have never been good with. If Mariota goes down, it's Tannehill leading the charge, in what will *certainly* be his breakout season. Sorry, guys.

Week 14: @ Buccaneers (W)

Bruce Arians gets to face his former team at home in Tampa. But he's also in the process of retooling that roster. I think there may be a dangerous pass rush, but on the whole, I don't think this is going to be super close.

Week 15: @ Saints (L)

The Colts have a *rough* slate of road games this year. @Chargers, Chiefs, Steelers, and now Saints. The four best QBs on their schedule are all away games, and I think Brees will be able to carve up the Colts' secondary. But if he does fall off a cliff, like people are expecting him to do a la Peyton Manning in 2015, this could easily flip the other way.

Week 16: vs Panthers (L)

This is the closest home game I think the Colts will have this season, unless Newton falls off from that injury. While the Panthers don't have the best weapons on either side of the ball, Newton and CMC are both incredibly dangerous in their own right and I see them giving the Colts' defense a lot of trouble, while Kuechly shows Leonard what it means to be the best LB in the league. Also, odd-year Panthers. A big learning experience, but I think the Panthers take it.

Week 17: @ Jaguars (L)

Yikes. Ending the regular season on a three game skid doesn't bode well, but the Jgauars are always a tough team to play in Jacksonville. This game will certainly have playoff implications and may even decide the overall positioning of the AFCS. But unfortunately, I think Jacksonville is going to have the same effect it always does.

I realize this isn't the most optimistic take that any Colts' fan has. A lot of people are expecting a minimum of 10-6, probably a 12-4 season. There will be plenty of exciting games, and if the Colts get lucky in just the right games, I think it's also very possible for them to beat the Steelers, Panthers, and Texans in Houston to wind up 12-4. But that road schedule just seems a little bit too tough to get too optimistic. As far as postseason predictions go, if they manage to snag the wild card or even the division, I'd expect them to make it to the second round and lose to the team that got a bye again, although much closer.
 

#Training Camp Battles:

According to Chris Ballard, if there aren't training camp battles for roster spots, you're building your team wrong. That's certainly true this year, and there's only one or two position groups that don't have strong battles for at least a spot on the team. Here are the highlights:

WR:

The Colts currently have 13 WRs on the roster. They'll probably carry only 5 or 6 in the regular season. That means between Daurice Fountain, Marcus Johnson, Steve Ishmael, Penny Hart, Chester Rogers, Deon Cain, and Zach Pascal, two of them will make the roster. The real battle is going to be between Cain, Pascal, Rogers, and Hart, but I wouldn't be shocked to see anyone in that group show up in camp.

CB:

The other huge position battle is at CB, like I mentioned earlier. Desir and Moore have locked up the top two spots, but Ya-Sin and wilson will be competing for coming on the field in nickel situations, while Hairston, Milton, Collins, and Tell will all be competing to not be the last guy bumped off the roster. Whoever doesn't make this team will *probably* get picked up as a waiver claim.

DL:

The only part of the DL that's set in stone is the starting 4. Everything else is up for grabs. Muhammad and Ward will be battling for a spot and the rookies will be trying to show that they deserve to make the team this year. Lots of depth, lots of potential, and some very good players are going to get cut.

#Schemes:

**Offense:**

The point of the Colts' offense is that there *isn't* a specific scheme. If I *had* to classify it, I'd call it a West Coast offense. On days when they played teams with strong secondaries and safeties, they kept the passes short and quick, relying on dinking and dunking their way down the field. If there was a hole in the secondary, it would get exploited for deep plays. As soon as you've caught on to the quick tempo, a long developing deep play catches the defense on their heels. But, as soon as you've got that figured out, you wind up with Frank Reich and Nick Sirianni saying they want to have a top-5 rushing team this season, and they have the offensive line to turn it into a ground-and-pound team. We'll know what the offensive scheme will look like when we see it on the field.

The Colts are set up to play whatever personnel they think fits best against the defense. If they want to go 11, they've got 4 WRs fighting to get on the field, 4 RBs fighting to get on the field, and 3 TEs fighting to get on the field. If they want to go jumbo, they've got a 6th OL that could start on a handful of other rosters (Haeg) and 2 TEs that excel at blocking (Doyle and Alie-Cox). If they want to play to speed, they use Hines, TY, and Campbell the most. If they want size, it's Ebron, Cain, and Mack. Campbell and Hines can both play in the slot or out of the backfield, and both will probably see a handful of jet sweeps through the season. This team has depth at every position, and the idea is that in order to adequately cover everyone, you'll need to have 13 people on the field. Because don't forget, Luck is still a threat running.

The Offensive Line is going back to the ""golden age"" of Indianapolis under Howard Mudd. While it seems pretty built for more of a power look, Mudd as a coach emphasizes technique before anything, something that, according to players, wasn't terribly important last year. Mudd tends to prefer a more aggressive blocking scheme, which leads me to think it'll be more of a man scheme than a zone scheme.

On the whole, this offense will *probably* be a pretty up-tempo **West Coast-style offense, with a power running twist**. But they've got the depth to do pretty much whatever they want.

**Defense:**

The defensive scheme last season was a zone-heavy Cover 2, in the style of a Tampa 2. This year, it's supposed to get more complex. The goal is to have the depth to have a constant rotation of 9 defensive linemen, allowing for a ""hurricane"" approach, similar to the Eagles in 2017. While Nickel packages have become the de-facto base defense across the league, the Colts ""official"" base is a 4-3 and in the switch to Nickel, they prefer a 4-2-5 rather than a 3-3-5, taking the SAM linebacker off the field instead of pulling off a DL. Part of this is because of the tendency to not blitz, though. Instead, they relied almost entirely on their front 4 to generate pressure, with the occasional LB spy sneaking in for a sack.

The defensive front is designed as a 1-gap front 4, emphasizing pass rush more than anything. However, when it comes to the DEs, the strong side end is being asked to be a better run defender. With Sheard now injured, it remains to be seen who will step up there. Last season, there were also a lot of twists and stunts that were used to generate some pressure, and Margus Hunt in particular feasted those first few weeks. As the season went on and teams figured it out, they didn't work quite as well. But even with the front 4 struggling at times to generate pressure, the Colts refused to blitz. They finished the season in the bottom 5 of blitz rates. However, at the end of the season, they seemed more willing to accept help from blitzes. The team also really only has one ""traditional"" big-bodied DT in Grover Stewart. This is definitely a defensive line designed to rush the passer first, stop the run second.

The reason the DL can worry about the passer instead of the rush is the LB group. With a zone-heavy scheme in the secondary, the LBs frequently get tasked with covering the zones in the middle of the field. The Tampa 2 wrinkle is that the MLB actually drops back to turn a Cover 2 into a Cover 3, which requires some insane athleticism. The SAM is also the first one off the field when extra DBs are called for in this defense, which means that the other two LBs need to be athletic enough to cover TEs, RBs, and the occasional slot receiver. In addition, they get tasked with a spy role sometimes (and that's exactly how Leonard got his first NFL sack). With all these roles, the LBs need to not only be incredibly athletic, they also need to be intelligent and be able to diagnose an offensive look and a play direction pretty much at the snap. The DL has a pretty simple role, but a *lot* is being asked of the LBs that are on the field.

The secondary is so zone-heavy that they played zone on over 80% of snaps, far and away the most in the NFL last season. The point of a Cover-2 is that you've got the two safeties covering the deep zones over the top, allowing the CBs to cover the boundaries while the LBs cover the middle. Interestingly, though, the Colts have built their CB corps to... play man. Desir, Wilson, and Ya-Sin all excel at playing man coverage, as opposed to zone. With Eberflus's promise that the defense will be more complex this year, we're all expecting it to include many, many more man looks. The safeties and the LBs are the secret sauce in this defense, though. Everyone has heard about Darius Leonard's crazy good season. But Malik Hooker as the Free Safety is the glue that holds the secondary together. He's intimidating enough to shut down his half of the field entirely and has had more interceptions than TDs allowed so far in his career.

Based on what we saw last year, the *base* defense will be a **4-3 Tampa 2 style** defense, though we’ll see primarily nickel and dime packages. Heavy emphasis on speed, tackling ability, and turnovers.

39,Offseason Review 2019: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers,"**Division:** NFC South (5-11 2018 Record)

**Head Coach:** Bruce Arians

**Offensive Coordinator:** Byron Leftwich

**Defensive Coordinator:** Todd Bowles

#Intro: the Two Voices Inside my Head
ALL ABOARD THE BLAINE TRAIN! Did you come here expecting hype about Bruce Arians? How he’d save Jameis Winston and bring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers back to relevance? Well, you’ve come to the wrong place because you, my friends, have a first-class ticket on the Blaine Train. Ndamukong Who? Shaq Ferret? No one cares. We signed Blaine Gabbert and *that was the coolest thing we did this offseason.* I’m joking, obviously, but I’m not really sure if I’m joking. 

Anyhow, what a surreal offseason it’s been for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Stuck somewhere between a renovation and a rebuild, the team made a complete change to our coaching staff top-to-bottom, cut fan favorite turned heel Gerald McCoy, and began implementing a new 3-4 Defensive Scheme under Todd Bowles. 

Despite these changes, a few constants remain (for better or worse, but mostly worse). Jason Licht returns for year #6 with only a 27-53 (.34) record and no playoff appearances. Jameis Winston enters the 5th and final year of his rookie deal with little to show so far other than making headlines for peeing on his grandma’s house, getting handsy in Ubers, and slurping on his fingers maniacally to hype his teammates up. 

When it comes to the Bucs, I *generally* have a decent idea of how this team is going to perform, the exception being 2017 where I was wildly off. Here’s my last four years of predicting the Bucs success: 


**Year**| **My Prediction**| **Actual**
---|---|----
2015| 7-9| 6-10
2016| 10-6| 9-7
2017| 10-6| 5-11
2018| 5-11 | 5-11

So where does that leave us in 2019? *The truth is, I have absolutely no idea.* There are two voices inside my head. There’s a voice beckoning to the jaded fan that urges me to get on this new hype train brought to you by Bruce Arians. There’s another grizzled voice within that has accepted nothing but incompetence from the old guard that remains. There are two ways I could see this season unfolding. I’ll give them to you as fake news headlines. 

**Scenario 1: Bucs go 7-9 and narrowly miss the playoffs** 

**Scenario 2: Bucs go 3-13. Jason Licht is fired. Bruce Arians retires after one season. Bucs go back to rebuild mode…again.**

#Coaching Notes: Bucs Hire Brue Arians 
The Dirk Koetter era is one fans can look back on in disappointment. Originally promoted from OC under Lovie Smith to Head Coach, Koetter was retained for the sake of continuity with Jameis when there appeared to be a threat he’d be hired as a Head Coach elsewhere. What Dirk brought instead was predictive linearity on offense, little to no innovation, and lacking any concrete answers for how to fix the team. After three seasons, he was axed. 

Enter Bruce Arians: the lovable, quotable, Crowne Royale and paint guzzling Coach responsible for turning the Cardinals back into a contender and being a QB whisperer for a pretty amazing list of players including Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, Carson Palmer, Ben Roethlisberger…and Blaine Gabbert. 

With Arians’ age, health, and previous retirement, the hire feels like a short-term solution and a Hail Mary hire to put a competent Coach in front of the team Licht’s built. Make no mistake of it: the biggest factor hinging on the Bucs success (or failure) will be what Bruce Arians is able to do with Jameis Winston in a contract year. 

In four seasons of play, Jameis Winston is beginning to look like a player whose ceiling is Jay Cutler. For every dazzling performance he puts on like his 5 TD rookie performance against the Eagles, you see facepalm-worthy decision-making and multiple turnover games. In 54 starts, Jameis has thrown for 58 interceptions while also fumbling the ball 38 times (with 16 lost) for an average of 1.37 turnovers per game. 

Notably, Jameis Winston has played 14 career games with 3+ turnovers—compared to 11 games with 0. Ugly? Yes. But you’ll notice in every one of these posts I’ve never labeled Jameis with the dreaded “B” word. Mixed in with the stupid, you still see the flashes of why he was the #1 pick, and it’s the flashes of non-dumbassery that make me hopeful for Arians’ arrival. Arians may be a short-term solution for us, but in the event he manages to turn Jameis into player we envisioned him to be, it will make the risk it worth his biscuit. 

Accompanied by Arians is his former Arizona Defensive Coordinator Todd Bowles, who looks to install a 3-4 Defense, and Buccaneer legend-turned Offensive Coordinator Byron Leftwich. 
This Motley Crue of coaches has a laundry list of issues to fix, including: 

* Making Jameis Winston not suck
* Bruce Arians has a track record of turning two sexual assailants in Ben Roethlisberger and Peyton Manning and turning them into consent-loving superstar QB’s. Maybe he can do that with Jameis too? 
* Restoring the disaster defense that Leslie Frazier made into an embarrassment and Mike Smith turned into a nuclear pisspile 
* Learning how to stop a slant route, which, again, has been an issue for a decade now 
* Coaching up the 25 DB’s Jason Licht has picked in the last two years of the draft. 
#2019 Draft Analysis

Once upon a time there was a GM named Jason Licht. Jason took over a team with an abysmal offense and a lightbulb appeared and he said “we have to use so many draft picks to address this terrible offense.” So in the first 11 rounds of his tenure as GM, Jason Licht picked *only offensive players.*
When our Defense suffered accordingly, everyone had a very shocked Pikachu face!

Well, this year, Jason Licht said “I know Demar Dotson is a Free Agent after this season, I know Donovan Smith is a terrible LT, and I know Caleb Benenoch is abysmal too,” and so to address our OL problems, Jason Licht decided to draft 5 defenders, a special teams player, and only one offensive player (a 6th rounder who I don’t think is particularly impressive by any means). Jason Licht is the worst GM since Gene Smith. At this rate, he may even push Matt Millen for the biggest idiot. Here’s my analysis of why Jason Licht’s picks sucked. Again. 

Round/Pick|Player|Analysis|
--|--|--|
**Round 1, #5 Overall**|Devin White (LB – LSU)| The most frustrating thing about the Devin White selection was that it confirmed that Jason Licht is the kind of poker player who would start giggling maniacally if he had a Full House and would cry hysterically if he had to fold. Just as it was no surprise when the Bucs took Vernon Hargreaves III in 2016, Devin White to the Bucs was a horribly kept secret. The pick itself? Riskier than most would assume, as White has a tendency to whiff on tackles in over-pursuit (PFF credits White with missing 13% of his tackles over the previous two seasons). Tackling deficiencies aside, White is a speed demon LB with excellent coverage skills. For a look at just how much of a threat he can be all over the field, I recommend a view of his 2018 game against Auburn. There’s another underlooked quality that White possesses that’s blown me away in a short period of time: his leadership skills. Seriously, take 5 minutes of your time today to watch one of his press conferences. He has such a dynamic personality that in another life, he could run for office or become a minister. He’s that engaging a person, and for a team that has had leadership issues for the greater part of a decade, his attitude alone will be uplifting to a milquetoast team. White also benefits by having two exceptional DT’s to play behind in Vita Vea and Ndamukong Suh. Paired with Lavonte on the inside, White is my favorite to win DROY. His transition to the NFL won’t be without growing pains, but it’s a pick that fills a huge need and should be an upgrade over the recently departed (and overrated) Kwon Alexander. |
**Round 2, #39 Overall**|Sean Murphy-Bunting (CB – Central Michigan)| And with Greedy Williams still on the board, we picked…Sean Murphy-Bunting. The pick seemed like a little bit of a reach to me. Let’s first talk about the things I like about SMB. He’s good at using his hands to force receivers outside, and watching his tape, there were very few cases where he got burned. His 9 interceptions in three years is respectable, and he only allowed a 41.5 passer rating when being targeted last year. Things I don’t like…it seems like on almost every run play he got thrown around like a ragdoll and couldn’t provide any tangible support there. Similar to the issues I saw with Carlton Davis III’s college tape, while I mentioned SMB was good with forcing receivers outside, he seemed to fail to grasp when to take his hands off. This could be a problem that will draw flags. I’m whelmed by this pick.|
**Round 3, #94 Overall**|Jamel Dean (CB – Auburn)| A high risk/high reward potential draft pick here. Dean has had serious knee injuries throughout his career (three, in fact), and he comes with only one season as a starter. He’s a freak athlete who ran a 4.3 at the Combine and that speed showed up on his game tape too. Against Alabama, in particular, he was tested on the deep ball a few times and stayed with his receiver in stride, giving up no big plays. Unlike SMB, he isn’t much of a turnover machine. This to me was a pick based more on his potential than his production. Lukewarm on it. |
**Round 3, #99 Overall**|Mike Edwards (S – Kentucky)| Woah nelly I did not like this pick. You know how when you turn on Rookie mode in Madden and the safeties bite on play action almost every time? That’s what I saw with Mike Edwards. [*Example*](https://youtu.be/UIwK3I5yNg0?t=1) He’s undersized and it shows when he came into the box for run support and got mandhandled. Angles he took on tackles were often whiffed. I guess he plays with intensity, but intensity is not a substitute for ability. I’ve been wrong many times but this was probably my least favorite pick of this draft.| 
**Round 5, #145 Overall**|Matt Gay (Thiccer – Utah)| Yes, make your memes, laugh at us. We drafted another ~~Kicker~~ Thiccer with Roberto Aguayo hardly in the rearview mirror. Why do I call him a Thiccer? Because he’s about 250 pounds of Mormon Thiccness. I read an article that said he worked at a Brazilian steakhouse, and he looks like he never told the waiters to stop bringing him meat (who would). So look: we have been royally cursed at Kicker. Roberto Aguayo, Nick Folk, Chandler Catanzaro, Kyle Brindza, Mike Nugent, etc. have cost us games and made embarrassments of our franchise. So when Licht rolled the dice on Gay, I had *zero issue* with it, given how many 5th round picks he’s wasted in the past (I’m looking at you Kadeem Edwards, Jeremy McNichols, and Kenny Bell!) Gay may not beat out Cairo Santos for the job, but I don’t have any qualms with burning a draft pick to address a serial need for us.|
**Round 6, #208 Overall**|Scotty Miller (WR – Bowling Green)| I don’t think Scotty Miller makes the final roster. While Bowling Green used him as an outside vertical threat, Miller looks to me like he’s best suited in the slot. Miller’s separation was unimpressive to me from the limited tape I saw. Not a lot to be excited for here.|
**Round 7, #215 Overall**|Terry Beckner Jr. (DT – Missouri)| He may be Terry Beckner Jr., but if you look at how he’s bulked up, it looks like Terry Becker Jr. ate Terry Beckner Sr. As a 7th round pick, Beckner isn’t a guy likely to make the team. And that’s about all I have to say here because no one really knows anything about 7th round picks.|


#Schedule Predictions

Week|Opponent|Prediction|Analysis|
--|--|--|--|
**Week 1**|49ers| **24-13 Bucs** (1-0)|I really like what the 49ers have been doing to invest in their front 7. The rest of their roster strategy has been suspect, particularly in free agency. Bucs start the season with a win here.|
**Week 2**|@Panthers| **23-20 Bucs** (2-0)|Hard to tell what the state of the Panthers is. After starting the season 6-2, they proceeded to lose the next 7 in a row. Cherry picked stat: Cam has lost in 3 of his last 4 primetime games, and this happens to be a SNF game. I arbitrarily believe Bucs will win this one in OT.|
**Week 3**|Giants| **34-31 Giants** (2-1)|There are so  many things I don’t like about this game. For some reason, Eli Manning has always had the Bucs’ number. Since Eli was drafted, the Giants have won 6 of their 7 matchups against Tampa. “Eli Manning won’t be the starting QB by that point,” you say? Bucs have a tendency to play poorly against rookie QB’s. Also, Saquon Barkley is a mean, mean man.|
**Week 4**|@Rams| **38-31 Rams** (2-2)| And thus begins the most important stretch of the Bucs season where we don’t play a single in Tampa from September 29 – November 10 (you read that right). Don’t buy the anti-Goff narrative. He’s still one of the best QB’s in the league. That DL is nasty, and with our inadequate interior OL, this will be one of those stat producing games for the Donald that will put him in the running for a third consecutive DPOY.|
**Week 5**|@Saints | **43-20 Saints** (2-3)|I’m expecting a Drew Brees nightmare game here that picks apart our young and inexperienced secondary. Want to know how to experience trial by fire as a rookie? You play Drew Brees. And then you die.|
**Week 6**|Panthers (in London)| **37-31 Bucs** (3-3)|I hope the Players Union puts their foot down on London games when the CBA is renegotiated. Either make a London franchise or kill this idea. It’s a logistical nightmare, players are taxed exorbitantly, and the short week/travel makes game preparation a doozy.  It screws over season ticket holders too. Flip a coin. We usually split the series with the Panthers but I’ll pick the Bucs here. I think.|
**Week 7**|Bye Bye Bye| **N/A**|Something bad always happens at the Bye week.|
**Week 8**|@Titans| **31-27 Bucs** (4-3)|Like the Bucs, Titans are in a make or break year with Mariota. I’d put Corey Davis on my list of breakout players this year. Expect an All-Pro quality season from him. Expect these two QB’s to air it out here.|
**Week 9**|@Seahawks| **20-17 Seahawks** (4-4)|Hard to ever pick against the Seahawks when they’re playing at home, but here’s a random fact: We’ve played the Seahawks four times this decade. We won three of those games (most recently 2016). Our one loss was in overtime (2013) and they wound up winning the Super Bowl that year. That’s still a strong team and I expect a low-scoring slugfest.|
**Week 10**|Cardinals| **44-37 Bucs** (5-4)|The Brucifer gets to play his old team here. Like I mentioned before: Rookie QB’s have a way of breaking out with the Bucs. I’m anticipating a high scoring slobber knocker. Side note: keep an eye on Hakeem Butler. He was a flawed player at Iowa State with a troubling drop rate, but he’s a target Murray could turn to early. I’m a big fan.|
**Week 11**|Saints| **37-33 Saints** (5-5)|One day Drew Brees will retire and then my rectum will heal.|
**Week 12**|@Falcons| **33-27 Falcons** (5-6)|Hard to believe fact (but maybe easy to believe): the last time the Bucs beat the Falcons was in 2016. A lot of that has to do with Julio Jones, who has now amassed 102 catches for 1,695 yards against the Bucs with 11 TD’s in 14 games. We haven’t been able to stop him, and it haunts us.|
**Week 13**|@Jaguars| **20-17 Jaguars** (5-7)|Jaguars are a weird team. Top to bottom, they have one of the most loaded rosters in the NFL, and they went from near Super Bowl team to meltdown in 2018. If that repeats this year, Marrone’s a goner. I expect this to be a run-heavy game on both sides.|
**Week 14**|Colts| **37-27 Colts** (5-8)|Andrew Luck could very well be in the running for MVP this year. He’s looking as good as he did pre shoulder injury. Ballard is a nice contrast to Grigson. I can tell you one thing that will happen in this game: there will be violence with Suh and Earl Grey.|
**Week 15**|@Lions| **31-28 Bucs** (6-8)|Neither team has much of a threat in the secondary. This is one that could turn into a Jameis-Stat Padford shootout.|
**Week 16**|Texans| **31-20 Texans** (6-9)|The last time the Bucs played the Texans, Donovan Smith didn’t allow a sack. However, I distinctly remember J.J. Watt handling Donovan Smith like a ragdoll throughout that game. At that time, they didn’t have Clowney or Watson on their roster either. This ain’t going go tbe a fun one.|
**Week 17**|Falcons| **28-3 Bucs** (7-9)|I expect the Bucs to rally for one final win at home to end a disappointing season.|

#Projected Starting Lineup &amp; Analysis: Offense

**QB- Jameis Winston:** The likelihood of Jameis putting up an MVP-caliber season in a contract year is equal to that of him putting up Cutler numbers and becoming a UFA following this season. My confidence is somewhere in the middle. With the receiving weapons he has in Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, OJ Howard, and Cameron Brate, the excuses are running out, but there are plenty of fans who would tell you otherwise.  *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 4,321 yards, 65.1% completion percentage, 32 TD’s, 17 INT’s* 

**WR1 – Mike Evans:** By no fault of his own, I’d actually anticipate Mike Evans’ production taking a dip from his 1,500+ yards from last season, mostly due to more targets going to OJ Howard and Chris Godwin. Stats aside, Evans is the best pick of the Jason Licht era. I do worry about his health. “His health?” you say. “He’s missed only two games due to injury in his career!” And you’re right. But watching Evans play, many of the balls he catches are thrown high enough that he’s exposing himself more and more to brutal hits to grab them. Watch some of the hits he takes. It’s disconcerting to see him extend himself for high thrown balls only to get drilled in the ribs by a safety at full speed an instant later. The more Jameis’s accuracy improves, the longer Evans’ career will be. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 81 receptions, 1,303 yards, 7 TD’s* 

**WR2 – Chris Godwin:** Godwin’s progression has been a thrill to watch. His route running has improved immensely, his blocking is among the best in the league, and he seems to shake off big hits like Malik McDowell shakes off getting tazed in a 7/11. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 67 receptions, 961 yards, 4 TD’s*

**RB – Payton Barber:** It’s a hyperbolic statement, of course, but I’ve often quipped that if every player on the Bucs had Barber’s gumption, we’d be a 12-4 team every year. Barber isn’t a top 20 back in the NFL, but I love his intensity. A former boss of mine was a reserve OT. I once asked him who the toughest player he played against was in college. He told me Matt Roth and Mathias Kiwanuka. When I asked him why, he told me “because those guys played like they hated you.” That’s Payton Barber. Every touch he runs like he’s Inigo Montoya and you killed his father. He’s not a complete back by any means, but he gets the job done adequately. By the way, keep an eye on UDFA Bruce Anderson. It wouldn’t shock me if he supplants Barber as the starter by the end of the season. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 721 Rushing yards (3.8 YPC), 5 TD’s* 

**TE – Oterius Jabari Howard:** The narrative says that Bruce Arians has never used TE’s in his offense. The reality says that Bruce Arians has never had adequate TE’s. Now he has two in Howard and Brate. If he stays healthy, Howard can be a top TE in the league. That’s a big if though. I’ve written in the past that Howard stays too upright when he’s got the ball in his hands. He’s a 6’6 target. He needs to lower his bad level and protect himself better. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 57 receptions, 709 yards, 6 TD’s*

**LT – Donovan Smith:** I absolutely hate how inflated the LT market is right now. Only could a player as inadequate as Donovan Smith get top 5 money and *actually be making what he’s worth.* A lot of fans knocked the deal, but it made sense. There was no marquee LT available in Free Agency, and our draft needs were vast. Smith’s deal amounts to a 2-year extension and we can cut him after 2020 without incurring dead cap. Nevertheless, four years in, I’ve seen absolutely nothing to inspire confidence. He remains a liability, and I see little upside. 

**LG – Ali Marpet:** If Mike Evans is our best player on Offense, Ali Marpet is a distant 2nd. Don’t take my word for it. Take the always controversial Madden ratings, who rated him as the #1 LG in the league.  The hype train attention is all on Quentin “Earl Grey” Nelson right now. Marpet deserves your eye too. I predict he’ll make 2nd Team All-Pro this year. 

**C – Ryan Jensen:** So far, Jensen is looking like the next Jason Licht big money Free Agent bust. Like most gingers, he’s an undisciplined hot-headed mess who rarely added value. Jensen may be better suited to play Guard, but alas, he’s our only option right now. 

**RG – Caleb Benenoch:** Caleb Benenoch is pretty bad at football. He’s not Garrett Gilkey bad, but he seems to have zero mean streak and can’t open up holes in the run game if his life depended on it. If I’m any defensive coordinator, I’m sending blitzers up the A-Gap between Benenoch and Jensen because that would make us eat some L’s. I don’t expect a year three leap for Benenoch. I expect him to remain a huge liability. 

**RT – Demar Dotson:** Dotson’s slowing down as father time finally caught up, but he’s still one of the only sufficient members of the Bucs’ OL. . Entering the final year of his deal, he’s likely to become a UFA after the season. Good think Jason Licht drafted a successor for him this year. Oh wait a second. 

#Projected Starting Lineup &amp; Analysis: Defense
*Note on this section: I’m still unsure as to how Bowles’ 3-4 scheme is going to work. For example, is Vita Vea going to play 0-tech? 1-tech? Are Noah Spence and Shaq Barrett going to bounce back and forth between 7-tech and 9? So for now, I’m writing this as RE, LE, DT, DT, with the expectation that there will be flexibility.* 

**EDGE – Shaq Barrett:** Last season, Jason Pierre-Paul became the Bucs first 10+ sack guy since Simeon Rice. And then he got in a car accident that might sideline him for the whole season. It’s a Bucs life. Barrett was one of the more low-key FA signings for the Bucs this offseason. Overshadowed by Chubb and the Vonald, Barrett came in as a rotational guy and played just over 270 snaps last year. He’ll get a chance to be a starter in Tampa. I expect most of the Bucs pressure to be generated up the middle, but Barrett should get an Ayers number of sacks. *Probably wrong projected stats: 5.5 sacks.*

**0-Tech - Tevita Tuliʻakiʻono Tuipulotu Mosese Vaʻhae Fehoko Faletau Vea:** Vea had a rocky start to his rookie season. Slowed by a calf strain sustained in Training Camp, Vea spent the beginning of the season learning the nuances and speed of the game. By the end of the season, he was looking like a force of nature, drawing double teams, throwing OL around like rag dolls, and blowing up run plays. If Vea transitions to a 0-tech role, I could see his numbers taking a dip, but 0-tech is not a position of glamor (someone needs to have a serious HoF discussion about Wilfork and Hampton). I’m excited to see Vea paired with Suh on the inside. Together, they form one of the best interior duos in the league. Keep an eye on Vea. He’s our most promising defender at this point. *Probably wrong projected stats: 4.5 sacks.* 

**5-Tech – Ndamukong Suh:** America’s favorite ball stomping donkey kicker comes to Tampa! Changing the attitude in Tampa starts with the players we have, and as much as I loved McCoy, his low-key demeanor just wasn’t the leadership we needed. Suh, as I’m sure you know is one of the nastiest (and dirtiest) players in the league, a throwback to the old school “this is football copypasta” kind of player. Suh was largely overshadowed by The Donald in L.A., but watching tape of him, he’s still one of the better DT’s in the league despite his taking a secondary role. Expect a spike in numbers for him. *Probably wrong projected stats: 6.5 sacks.* 

**EDGE – Carl Nassib:** What a pleasant surprise Nassib turned out to be for us last year. After drawing national attention for his hilarious financial advice on Hard Knocks, the Browns cut him at the end of camp. But as they say, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Nassib managed to pull 6.5 sacks for us and number of additional pressures. He’ll likely be the bookend Edge opposite Barrett, with Willie Gholston coming in on obvious run downs. *Probably wrong projected stats: 6.0 sacks.* 

**ILB – Lavonte David:** If the public paid any mind to the importance of a solid non-sack producing 4-3 Will, Lavonte David would have probably made All-Pro in just about every season of his career. Alas, despite having been the best at his craft, the fake news sports media has slept on him every year. With the transition to a 3-4, Lavonte will bounce inside. Both his and White’s speed and versatility will be helpful in mixing up blitz packages. Speaking of which, I hope we get more blitzing instead of base defenses which is all we got from Mike Smith. *Probably wrong projected stats: 3.5 sacks, 3 INT’s* 

**ILB – Devin “Get Live 45” White:** See above analysis. But, as an aside, I bought a custom made “Get Live 45” jersey. *Probably wrong projected stats: 3.0 sacks, 1 INT.*

**FS – Justin Evans:** I am completely unsure as to who ends up our starting DB’s. Zero clue. I’ll start with Justin Evans, who begins the season on the PUP List due to a lingering toe injury. Evans has shown flashes od potential when on the field. His aggressive playstyle and closing speed to the ball reminded me a lot of Troy Polamalu. Once his tackling improves he could be an asset for us. *Probably wrong projected stats: 1.5 sacks, 1 INT’s*

**SS – Jordan Whitehead:** For a guy coming in and starting by the end of the season as a rookie 4th rounder, Whitehead exceeded expectations and then some. He had a great nose for the ball, great timing on disrupting routes, and really good coverage skills. Loved what I saw of him and think he will take a big leap forward…if he can stave off the other 40 DB’s Licht drafted. *Probably wrong projected stats: 1.0 sacks, 3 INT’s*

**CB – Vernon Hargreaves III:** No player on the Buccaneers is more of an unknown than VH3. His rookie season was an absolute disaster to the point that it looked like QB’s were playing monkey in the middle with him. He had a small 3-4 game stretch of his 2nd season where he didn’t look like Sabby Piscitelli. When expectations were high for him to make a big leap in 2018, he went to IR after week 1. The Bucs picked up his 5th year option despite these setbacks. VH3 could still turn his career around, but he’s beginning to look like an unfortunate story. *Probably wrong projected stats: 2 INT’s*

**CB – Carlton “It’s not Unusual to be Loved by Anyone” Davis:** Rookie year, Davis came in and was surprisingly NFL ready. PFF credits him with allowing 435 yards, and that’s saying a lot for a guy who had to play against Brees, Newton, and Ryan for 6 games. I like his career trajectory. *Probably wrong projected stats: 2 INT’s*

#Training Camp Battles to Watch
1.	**Defensive Back Royal Rumble:** What happens when you throw M.J. Stewart, Carlton Davis, VH3, Mike Edwards, Jamel Dean, Justin Evans, and Jordan Whitehead into the ring for a royal rumble match? We’ll see. I predicted my starters above but I have absolutely no idea where this ends up. I think Ryan Smith will end up the odd man out and waived. 
2.	**Cairo Santos versus Matt Gay for the Cursed Kicker Title:** All indications show that Santos is having a good camp so far. It would take a bad camp from Gay not to keep Gay around, however. The job is Gay’s to lose, and pending any preseason game Parkey doinks, Gay will come out on top (pun possibly intended). 
3.	**Bruce Anderson versus Payton Barber: versus Ronald Jones III (Triple Threat Match):** Barber will be our starter, period. What Bruce Anderson is competing for here is a roster spot (always uphill as a UDFA), and from there, carries. I loved the Anderson signing and was surprised he wasn’t drafted. Here’s my hot take prediction: Ronald Jones will be a surprise cut and won’t make the final roster. 
4.	**Caleb Benenoch versus Alex Cappa:** Cappa was regarded as a project pick when he was drafted out of tiny Humboldt State and saw very limited action in 6 games last year. He’s one of the team’s unknowns, and while I think Benenoch will come out on top, Cappa may get starting snaps by the end of the year. 
5.	**Blaine Gabbert versus America:** Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. That fluttering feeling inside your soul is the essence of Blaine. But what if you go into the bathroom, turn out the lights, look in the mirror and say Blaine Gabbert 7 times? You will be mailed a VHS tape of the *Land Before Time 28.* You pop it in out of curiosity. It turns out it’s not *The Land Before Time 28* at all, but Blaine Gabbert highlights. You die a rapid death. On your hospital bed, you breathe your last breath, and it becomes essence of Blaine. This is the life of Blaine Gabbert. This is the curse he lives with. Embrace the essence of Blaine. 

#Non-Buccaneer Predictions for the Season 

1.	Last year, I predicted Mahomes would be our breakout player of the year (and said he’d be the most exciting player in the league for a long time. He won MVP!). The year before, I said it would be Goff. My breakout player for 2019? This year, I’ll go with two: Corey Davis will be a 1st Team All-Pro, and I expect Josh Jacobs to be an instant impact player. 
2.	MVP will go to Andrew Luck (or Carson Wentz). DPOY will go to Aaron Donald. OPOY will go to Joe Mixon. DROY will go to Devin White. OPOY will go to Josh Jacobs. COTY will go to Antony Lynn. Comeback player will go to Derrius Guice. 
3.	The AFC Championship will be played between the San Diego Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chargers will win. The NFC Championship will be played between the Eagles and the Rams. The Eagles will win. The Super Bowl will be played between the Eagles and the Chargers. The Chargers will win. Also I’m drunk but I got ¾ of these picks right last year so fuck you. 
4.	Sam Darnold isn’t going to amount to much as an NFL QB. Not this year, and probably not ever. 
5.	Foles is one of the all-time greatest backups. That’s his role. He’s not going to be much better than backup quality in Jacksonville. 
6.	The teams with the highest potential to land a top 5 pick, in no particular order: Cardinals, Dolphins, Giants, Bills, Lions. *Dark Horse: Ravens*

The main things that jumped out at me were as follows. 


-Of the 9 times in history that a QB has had 100+ rushing attempts and still finished with more than 8 wins, Cam Newton accounts for 3 of those seasons. Russell Wilson has done it twice, Randall Cunningham did it twice, Michael Vick did it once and RG3 did it once. 

-With the exception of Michael Vick’s 2004 season, everyone else on the list also threw at least 20 passing TDs on their way to 9 or more wins. Lamar Jackson had 5 passing TDs in his 7 starts, a pace that would only get him to 11 or 12 over a 16 game season. 

-Lamar Jackson fumbled 10 times in his 7 starts, which would put him on pace to fumble 22 times over a 16 game season. Not only is that close to being the all time most fumbles by a QB in a season, but it’s 5 fumbles worse than Randall Cunningham’s 17 fumbles in 1989, which was the most of any on this list. 

I did not include Lamar Jackson’s stats from the first 9 games of last season, as he came into those games in situational roles that do not portray an accurate view of how defenses would react to him as a starting QB. 

Given these 3 points, I do not believe Lamar Jackson’s production from the final 7 games of last year can lead to sustainable success for the Ravens, and if the Ravens intend to win 9 games or more in 2019, they will need to see significant improvement from Lamar Jackson as a passer and try to slow down his rushing pace to keep him healthy.",nfl,DanHam117,93,2019-08-01

82,"/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7-Round Tournament: Green Bay Packers","**[Introductory Post](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c8v3dh/rnfl_7on7_7round_tournament_introduction_to_a/?st=jxo3cg0u&amp;sh=d53b8724)**

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Green Bay Packers.**

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The first thing to do was look at who I wanted at quarterback, and my golden rule with quarterbacks, if at all possible, is to not use a first round spot on one. I’ll use the first round spot if there’s no other comparable options (like Peyton Manning with the Colts), but in this case, even though Aaron Rodgers is really good and is an eventual Hall of Fame player, I had to go with Bart Starr, because having a QB as great as him filling up a non-first round spot is too much value to pass up. Then, I plotted in the Hall of Fame players, which meant putting Paul Hornung at halfback in round one (he got the nod over James Lofton because there were fewer options at HB to choose from), Forrest Gregg on the offensive line in round two, and Jerry Kramer on the offensive line in round four.

Three spots left, and keep in mind that over half of the offense is comprised of Hall of Fame players. At this point, I needed a wide receiver, a HB/WR/TE flex, and an OL/TE flex. In the sixth round, the only good option that fit this description was Marco Rivera on the offensive line; the fact that he might be the worst player on this offense, and he’s a three-time Pro Bowler, is incredible. From there, I went with Boyd Dowler (a possible Hall of Fame player) in the third round, and I opted for Max McGee over Dorsey Levens in round five, simply because if I went with Levens, this team would have one WR/TE option, and that wouldn’t be ideal.

**Defense:** First, I had to put the Hall of Famers on there. This meant putting Ray Nitschke on in round three, and Herb Adderley on in round one (he got the nod over Dave Robinson because the secondary needed more help). For the second round, it came down to two options; however, I went with LeRoy Butler over Darren Sharper, simply because if we’re looking at just their careers with the Packers, Butler had the much better one.

Now, I had four rounds to go, so it was about filling in the blanks. There were quite a few combinations to choose from, and the only one that I felt like was a must-do was to put Bryce Paup in at linebacker in the sixth round spot. In round five, it came down to three options with Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila, Dave Hanner, and Aaron Kampman; I ended up going with Gbaja-Biamila, though this is truly a toss-up and if enough people want, I have no problem swapping him out with Kampman or Hanner. The best fifth round player is linebacker Roger Zatkoff, but looking at the DL options in the other rounds, the defensive line would be very weak if I didn’t put one of those guys here in the fifth round.

This left the fourth round and the seventh round left, with my team needing a joker and a defensive lineman. From here, there were really no good defensive line options in the 7+ spot, so I had to use the fourth round spot on one; the best player in the fourth round in that category was probably Lionel Aldridge, so I went with him. And, in the 7+ spot, needing to find anyone, I went with Hank Gremminger, though Deral Teteak at linebacker was definitely an option here.

 **/r/NFL Rates**

How good is this team? That’s where I want you guys to come in so that there’s an interactive element before we do the postseason voting in a month. Based on the roster that you saw, how far do you think this team can go? Will they be a first round exit, or will they make it all the way to the championship?

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18407738)**

Note that for seeding purposes, I’m going to split it up between the AFC and NFC, and will rank the teams 1-16 in each conference based off of their lifetime winning percentage.

Yesterday, I asked how far you thought the Detroit Lions were going to go. Here were the results:

Round | Percentage
--- | ---
Round of 32 | 29%
Sweet 16 | 0%
Elite Eight | 8%
Final Four | 4%
Lose in the Championship | 4%
**Win the Championship** | **54%**

---

**Final Thoughts**

This team is pretty much the opposite of the Detroit Lions yesterday. Defensively, there are some question marks. There isn’t a true standout on the defensive line, and there are some holes that could be exploited against some of the better offenses in the field. However, when it comes to an offensive standpoint, the Packers are going to be tough to beat. They have a Hall of Fame quarterback, a Hall of Fame halfback, two really good receivers (with one of them in Dowler having a legitimate Hall of Fame case), and three offensive linemen who have combined for two gold jackets and 15 Pro Bowls. It would be shocking if this team didn’t win a few games when the tournament commenced, as they have the talent to go all the way.

We’ll do the 7-on-7 team for the **Minnesota Vikings** tomorrow at 11:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day for the next team’s roster.",nfl,JaguarGator9,7,2019-08-01

129,Who to watch in the Hall of Fame Game: Denver Broncos Edition,"Probably not many people will watch the game, let alone watch for players in it. But I am doing both of those things and thought I'd lay out who I'd recommend keeping an eye out for in the fun (up through the end of the third quarter or so, anyway).

**QB:** **Kevin Hogan**, as he makes a cameo appearance to try to interest other football teams. And of course **Drew Lock** in his first pseudo-NFL action. The preseason catches a lot of shit but I find it to be very instructive, especially at quarterback. When they're bad in the preseason, like really bad, they're rarely good on a real scoreboard. Paxton Lynch for example, and Christian Hackenberg, immediately looked lost, indecisive, and panicked on the field. For Lock it will be important to see if he looks similarly flummoxed coming out the gate.

**RB:** Lindsay and Freeman's roles are very much set but **Devontae Booker** is fighting for his roster spot. While likely the favorite, hot camp back **Khalfani Muhammed** is one to look for in the jockeying, though his skillset differs from Booker's. That the Broncos flirted with signing Theo Riddick is a clear indication that Booker, who fills a similar role for Denver, may not be a lock for the 53.

**WR:** This is one of the biggest battle zones on the roster, right now. **Da'Sean Hamilton** is the assumed WR3, slot man in the offense but that role is being challenged by others, so a good performance would be helpful for him. Broncos reach pick, camp star, and Philip Lindsay team mate - who helped convince the front office to take him - **Juwann Winfree** is maybe the biggest player to watch tonight as well as speedy outside receivers **Tim Patrick** and **Trinity Benson**, the latter of whom has enjoyed a good camp.

**TE:** Another slugfest for position here. **Noah Fant** isn't a guaranteed starter out the gate, as his blocking may determine whether he's an every down or package player, so keep an eye out for him in both capacities. Perennially hyped and perennially IR designated **Jake Butt** will also be worth paying attention to as his ceiling is very, very high - in theory - but he's lacked the chance to exercise it. **Jeff Heuerman** is still tenuously the starter at TE as well so, while his play may be  limited, he'll want to make a splash play or two to help ward off the superior talent behind him.

**OL**: Only a few here. There are rumblings that **Elijah Wilkinson**, who new OL coach Mike Munchak is quite taken with, may push Garrett Bolles for his job if the latter does not improve. How he holds up against the rush and in run blocking will be of considerable consequence tonight and through the preseason. **Connor McGovern** is taking the place of All-Pro Matt Paradis at Center, after having played guard prior in his career, and has had some serious difficulties handling shotgun snaps in camp. Keep an eye when the Broncos are in the gun to see if there are issues with the snap as, if there are, it could forecast serious issues come the regular season. Finally **second rounder Dalton Risner**, selected one pick ahead of Drew Lock, should see plenty of time at guard where I anticipate him doing the lord's work. If there's a pick in our draft class I believe may be a perennial pro-bowler, it's Risner.

**CB:**  Not a ton here, but **Isaac Yiadom** is going to see some considerable field time in this one, he was a third rounder a year ago and was, uh, pretty rough out there. Not Brendan Langley rough, we'll come back to him, but he got burned a lot in the preseason last year and then some more once CHJ went down late last year. But he's got a lot of good tools and needs polish so it'll be interesting to see how he comes along in Fangio's scheme which favors his play style more

**FS/SS:** This is our deepest position group behind Kareem Jackson, Justin Simmons, and Will Parks. **Jamal Carter** and **Su'a Cravens** are both super interesting rotational pieces in this defense that tends to highlight safety play. Both of these guys should see the field a lot and, particularly with Cravens, how he is used as a SS/ILB hybrid will be intriguing. The Broncos haven't had a good answer for RB/TE coverage for....goddamn ever, and he's an interesting option for it. Carter had a stellar preseason last year right up until he went down with a season ending injury, so if he can pick that back up will be something to watch.

**ILB** - Todd Davis is...fine, I guess, and Josey Jewell is still up and coming. So whoever our third ILB is they have a chance to see a ton of usage and maybe become our ILB 2 at a position we've needed help at since Danny Trevathan went to Chicago. **AJ Johnson** - who had a stellar college career before missing out on the NFL for years due to a contrived sexual assault charge - is one to watch here followed by **Joseph Jones** and **Kieshawn Bierria** - who may push the former from the depth chart.

Our **front four** are pretty baked but I would keep an eye on  **former second rounder Demarcus Walker** who only recently has been allowed to play his natural DE position instead of OLB.",nfl,an_actual_potato,23,2019-08-01

# Falcons vs Broncos

**Falcons vs Broncos:**  NFL is back! Or at least the preseason version. The league will begin its 100th season on Thursday from the Hall of Fame game between the Denver Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons.

The exhibition match will serve as an introduction to all the celebrations in Canton, Ohio, as the Professional Football Hall of Fame will hold its annual inaugural ceremony on Saturday.

# Falcons vs Broncos Live

Choosing the second round of the Broncos does not start on Thursday – this distinction belongs to Kevin Hogan – but with Joe Flacco sitting on it, Locke should see many representatives in his NFL debut. Just two weeks ago, Vic Fangio said that Locke “was not yet a quarterback – he pitches himself with difficulty, but does not yet know how to break him.”

Welcome to the big leagues, baby. Fangio’s assessment means that Locke is unlikely to succeed at Flacco any time soon. But that makes his pre-season shots all the more important.

The Broncos tried (and failed) to determine the QB franchise to replace Peyton Manning from 2016, driving through such as Trevor Simian, Brock Osweiler, Paxton Lynch and Case Kinum. Their eggs are now in several baskets after they exchanged for the 34-year-old Flacco and took Locke in the same offseason. In the next few weeks, we could find out if the latter has a higher ceiling and whether it should be considered as the future person of the franchise.

This is not the first time Quinn will call defensive games for Falcons. The five-year-old head coach assumed such responsibilities at the end of the 2016 season, when Atlanta launched its Super Bowl.

But he enters the season of 2019, feeling some heat after the Falcons missed the playoffs last year, while their defense occupied the bottom in almost all major statistical categories. Accordingly, Quinn replaced Marquanda Manuel with himself, noting the first time he won this title since he helped Sihokha lead successive Super Cups.

Quinn does not risk after the franchise for the fourth time in six years did not reach the season. Two of them were not on his watch, but the last time the Falcons did not go to the playoffs in a row, general manager Thomas Dimitroff introduced the coaching shift.

Atlanta, of course, played all or most of the season without key starters Dayon Jones, Ricardo Allen, Keanu Neal and Grady Jarrett. The quartet is now healthy, although don’t expect to see much from them in this game. But it will be a good opportunity to see Treasure 3, filmed exclusively by Quinn.

He worked on it for 40 years. When almost every NFL team is on the market for a new zigzagal coach last winter, the Broncos pounded. 60-year-old Fangio is not only inclined to defense, but also an elderly person. But do not take his age for weakness. The former DC Bears just finished directing one of the best defenses in the NFL, as he usually does. Now he finally gets the opportunity to manage the entire show.

While we wait to figure out what a big role he will take in the attack, keep in mind that the Broncos handed over the reunion with Gary Kubiak in this offseason in favor of Rich Skangarello, who has never been NFL and only did it at lower levels in college. (Incidentally, Skangarello spent a year with the Falcons as a quality control trainer at Quinn).

This step foreshadows Fangio’s desire for more influence, which makes sense when you consider how long it took him to reach this point. There is also a real need to maximize Denver’s veteran talent through the roster. After a disappointing two-year stay, Vance Joseph Fangio is not attracted to recovering one of the most prestigious league franchises. The Broncos constantly exist in the mode “won now.”

The new rules for loopholes are guaranteed to be valid only this season, so each game in 2019 is considered. After passing through several different iterations in the spring, the rules were finalized in June.

Recall that the intervention in the offensive and defensive passage can be considered in the last two minutes by an official replay, while coaches can challenge the intervention in all other parts of the rules. In addition, there will be more stringent criteria for reproducing interference in order to limit excessive stops. Like the standard for all reviews, calls will be canceled only if there is “clear and obvious visual evidence.”

Will this lead to the fact that the teams will get more chances on the field earlier than in the break or at the end of the games? Or even? How will the defenders respond? Will the new rules affect how officials call intervention in real time? Thursday will not show the intensity of the game of the regular season, especially the title game NFC (sorry Saints), but this may be the beginning of a paradigm shift for all participants.

Quinn does not risk after the franchise for the fourth time in six years did not reach the season. Two of them were not on his watch, but the last time the Falcons did not go to the playoffs in a row, general manager Thomas Dimitroff introduced the coaching shift.

Atlanta, of course, played all or most of the season without key starters Dayon Jones, Ricardo Allen, Keanu Neal and Grady Jarrett. The quartet is now healthy, although don’t expect to see much from them in this game. But it will be a good opportunity to see Treasure 3, filmed exclusively by Quinn.

He worked on it for 40 years. When almost every NFL team is on the market for a new zigzagal coach last winter, the Broncos pounded. 60-year-old Fangio is not only inclined to defense, but also an elderly person. But do not take his age for weakness. The former DC Bears just finished directing one of the best defenses in the NFL, as he usually does. Now he finally gets the opportunity to manage the entire show.

While we wait to figure out what a big role he will take in the attack, keep in mind that the Broncos handed over the reunion with Gary Kubiak in this offseason in favor of Rich Skangarello, who has never been NFL and only did it at lower levels in college. (Incidentally, Skangarello spent a year with the Falcons as a quality control trainer at Quinn).

This step foreshadows Fangio’s desire for more influence, which makes sense when you consider how long it took him to reach this point. There is also a real need to maximize Denver’s veteran talent through the roster. After a disappointing two-year stay, Vance Joseph Fangio is not attracted to recovering one of the most prestigious league franchises. The Broncos constantly exist in the mode “won now.”

The new rules for loopholes are guaranteed to be valid only this season, so each game in 2019 is considered. After passing through several different iterations in the spring, the rules were finalized in June.

Recall that the intervention in the offensive and defensive passage can be considered in the last two minutes by an official replay, while coaches can challenge the intervention in all other parts of the rules. In addition, there will be more stringent criteria for reproducing interference in order to limit excessive stops. Like the standard for all reviews, calls will be canceled only if there is “clear and obvious visual evidence.”

Will this lead to the fact that the teams will get more chances on the field earlier than in the break or at the end of the games? Or even? How will the defenders respond? Will the new rules affect how officials call intervention in real time? Thursday will not show the intensity of the game of the regular season, especially the title game NFC (sorry Saints), but this may be the beginning of a paradigm shift for all participants. A year ago, we saw how a new helmet rule seemed to have been over-punished in the pre-season period, before the market was eventually corrected",nfl,BrianMThacker,10,2019-08-01

218,The influence of income tax on the NFL salary cap or: How the Raiders could've had a free Luke Kuechly by leaving Oakland,"Throughout history, people hated paying taxes. And it makes sense, no one wants to give up their hard earned money for no reason. This also goes for athletes. Now, say I'm a *huge* free agent and I want to maximize my earnings. Because I'm stingy and hate the government, I'm only signing one-year deals so I can pick the team that pays the least taxes each year. This changes every year because of a very simple reason: in the NFL, you earn game checks that are taxed in that state in which the games are played. So while you're guaranteed 8 games at home, road games can mess up your tax plan massively. 

Because of how good of a player I am, I am guaranteeing myself a weekly paycheck that hits the top tax bracket in every state. I took the tax rates per state from [here](https://www.money-zine.com/financial-planning/tax-shelter/state-income-tax-rates/). The [results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPxbChQGUXReNOe8ZWpRnux0P_D9X7eDrLYp-VcfeS8/edit#gid=0) are...well, no idea if they're shocking, that just depends on whatever your expectation was. 

Now, the interesting part is what the difference between tax heaven (Jacksonville) and tax hell (Oakland) really means this year. For starters, it means that Marquise Lee (earning $9m this year, $8.85m AT) can see his bank account grow practically as much as Tyrell Williams ($10.1m this year, 8.98m AT) in 2019. It also means that the Raiders have a Jadeveon Clowney sized hole of $16m on their roster compared to the Jags, without doing the slightest bit wrong.

If Oakland had moved to Nevada (without income tax) this year, they'd have an accumulated tax rate of just 3.4%, raising their net salary cap to $181.6m, giving them basically a free Luke Kuechly (earning $12.4m avg) to spend. And all they'd have to do to get that, is fuck a city over!

*Yes, I know it's usually not* **this** *straight forward, but I just wanted a minor overview of how much income tax influences NFL teams and the salary cap. I'm also well aware not every salary cap dollar ends up in the top bracket as taxes don't work that way, but because of the money involved, a large enough ratio of those dollars end up in top bracket rates. And if not, I just can't be bothered to do the additional work honestly.*

233,Is Jason Garrett the new Rasputin Wayne Fontes?,"A coach that seemingly wins just enough games to stave off the hot seat longer than we think.

Wayne Fontes famously did this with the Lions- winning what Chris Berman on NFL Primetime used to call 'Rasputin Games,'  ones where Fontes' Lions were at a crossroads and seemed to win more often than not to get traction and cool off his hot seat.

Marvin Lewis, Rams Jeff Fisher, and SD Norv Turner were also Rasputin types.

Whenever Dallas is on the ropes (think Jacksonville/Philly last year) it’s tough to ignore the types of game you don't think the embattled coach can win, but does.

It'll be interesting to see how long he staves off the inevitable with the heat always high amidst his team, expectations, and his owner/GM.

This is the last year of his contract, so we shall see if he can Rasputin his way to another year or if he finally runs out of time ala Marvin Lewis",nfl,albundy66,7,2019-08-01

NFL games return on Thursday night, as the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons will face off in the Hall of Fame game, the first preseason game of the NFL slate. These preseason contests are not always the most exciting. Teams do not like to play their most important starters in most preseason games and the Hall of Fame game is the most extreme version of this.

Many key starters will be held completely out of action for both the Falcons and Broncos. However, this will still be a great chance for us to get a look at some of the young players who could have bright futures for both teams.

 

When it comes down to it, we will all just excited to have live football back in our lives. This Hall of Fame game may not be particularly important, let’s be honest, all of us are going to tune in.

The game will be televised on NBC on Thursday night, but you can also watch online via a live stream. Here are the complete details for the matchup between the Broncos and Falcons, including how to watch online.",nfl,Ruth9544,0,2019-08-01

319,Are the Jets actually gonna be good this year?,"As a Jets fan I think I will buy into it but first let me explain to you why I think they will.

**The second year of Darnold’s Career**

Darnold looks extremely good in camp, he has had days having only a few incomplete passes and no interceptions. Now this is just practice scrimmage but he looks amazing in practice. All of the coaches and players have raved about how much he has improved during the offseason. He is starting to totally grasp the concept of Gase’s offense and is torching our defense.


**New offensive weapons**

With the addition of Bell, Crowder, Montgomery and Osemele the offense has actual promise. Bell in his career has been easily a top 3 back in the NFL and he is crazy productive averaging over 1100 scrimmage yards every season. Crowder has looked promising as well and is a very dangerous receiver. His career has been plagued with injury but hopefully this year is different. 

We have been bolstering our OL with additions of Osemele and Kalil. Osemele has been very good with the raiders but tail-spinned when Gruden was brought on. With the Jets he already looks like a new man. Kalil just 3 seasons ago was a pro bowl center. He is a 5x pro bowler, 2x All Pro. He retired in 2018 but came out of retirement to play with the Jets. I guess Joe Douglas is working his magic already. 


With Adam Gase at the helm it will help to have a offensive mind to help Darnold grow into the promising Franchise QB he was drafted to be. All of the players have been raving about his ability to squeeze every ounce of talent out of players. He is a offensive mastermind and loves creating mismatches.


**A scary Jets’ defense**

Jamal Adams, Quinnen Williams, Marcus Maye, Leonard Williams, CJ Mosely, Trumaine Johnson, Avery Williamson, Jordan Jenkins are looking like the Avengers ready to take Thanos (Brady) to his inevitable doom... Okay maybe a little overboard but they do look very promising.

We had a pretty good offseason with Mosely and Bell. Mosely is an amazing Linebacker and led the Ravens defense for awhile. Hopefully we have a young star arise to fill our gap at edge rusher. Jenkins has solidified one side now we need another. Jachai Polite has first round talent and may be a draft STEAL but time will tell. Blake Cashman who was drafted this year is already turning heads and taking reps with the starters. He has absolutely stunning coverage skills and can lay down the boom.

We all know what Quinnen can do. Arguably the best talent in the draft and he is a monster.


**Summary**

This was a good offseason for the Jets and it looks to be promising so far. Now I’m not screaming playoffs at the top of my lungs but I think they put pieces in place to be a dominant force in the future. With a new look, New office, new faces of the already young team it might be interesting this season. Be on the lookout because the Jets might be playoff contenders if all goes well.

Only change I would make is Adams/Rodgers would be on the list instead of luck/Hilton. Brady and Edelman deserve #1 in my opinion because of unmatched post season production and clutchness.

348,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 66)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 66: 1985 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 8, 1985-January 26, 1986

Teams: 28

1985 NFL Draft: 336 selections (12 rounds), held in New York City, NY.

1985 First Draft Pick: Bruce Smith, Defensive End from Virginia Tech University (Buffalo Bills)

1985 AP Most Valuable Player: Marcus Allen, Running Back (Los Angeles Raiders)

Super Bowl XX: Chicago Bears (NFC) defeated New England Patriots (AFC) 46-10 at Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, LA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-Whenever a team time out is called after the two-minute warning of each half or overtime, it should only last a minute instead of 90 seconds.

\-A play is immediately dead anytime the quarterback performs a kneel-down (the quarterback immediately kneels down after receiving the snap) after the two-minute warning of each half, or whenever the player declares himself down by sliding feet first on the ground. The ball is then spotted at the point where the player touches the ground first.

\-Pass interference is not to be called when a pass is clearly uncatchable.

\-Both ""Roughing the kicker"" and ""Running into the kicker"" fouls are not to be called if the defensive player was blocked into the kicker.

\-The definition of a valid fair catch signal is clearly defined as one arm that is fully extended above the head and waved from side to side.

\-Goaltending (leaping up to deflect a kick as it passes through the goal posts) is illegal.

\-The officials' uniform changed slightly. Instead of wearing black stirrups with two white stripes over white sanitary hose, the officials began wearing a one-piece sock similar to those worn by players, black with two white stripes on top and solid white on the bottom. These were first worn the previous season in Super Bowl XIX.

\-Defensive backs were ruled to have an ""equal right to the ball"", meaning that pass interference would not be called if the defensive player was looking back attempting to intercept the ball, and that any contact with the receiver did not materially affect the receiver's ability to catch the ball.

The division format remained the same from the previous season, with 3 division champions and 2 wild cards per conference for the 10-team playoffs. The additional wild card team added a bye week in the post-season. The 2 wild card teams would  face each other in the opening round, and would advance to the Divisional Round. Since 1975, the NFL seeded teams based on Win/Loss Records. The division winners would be seeded in the top spots while any wild card teams would have the lower positions. The highest seeds remaining would host the conference title games. Please note, the league did not allow teams from the same division to meet in the divisional round of the playoffs until 1990.

The playoff qualifiers were:

|*AFC*|*Seed*|*NFC*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Los Angeles Raiders (12-4) \[West\]|*#1*|Chicago Bears (15-1) \[Central\]|

**Super Bowl XX**

The Chicago Bears and New England Patriots competed in Super Bowl XX at Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, LA. The attendance was 73,818 while NBC handled the broadcasting duties. The Bears were favored by 10 points.

The Patriots took the then-quickest lead in Super Bowl history after linebacker Larry McGrew recovered a fumble from Walter Payton at the Chicago 19-yard line on the second play of the game (the Bears themselves would break this record in Super Bowl XLI when Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff for a touchdown). Bears quarterback Jim McMahon took responsibility for this fumble after the game, saying he had called the wrong play. This set up Tony Franklin's 36-yard field goal 1:19 into the first quarter after three incomplete passes by Tony Eason (the first of which starting tight end Lin Dawson went down with torn ligaments in his knee). ""I looked up at the message board"", said Chicago linebacker Mike Singletary, ""and it said that 15 of the 19 teams that scored first won the game. I thought, yeah, but none of those 15 had ever played the Bears."" Chicago struck back with a 7-play, 59-yard drive, featuring a 43-yard pass completion from McMahon to wide receiver Willie Gault, to set up a field goal from Kevin Butler, tying the score at 3–3.

After both teams traded punts, Richard Dent and linebacker Wilber Marshall shared a sack on Eason, forcing a fumble that lineman Dan Hampton recovered on the Patriots 13-yard line. Chicago then drove to the 3-yard line, but had to settle for another field goal from Butler after rookie defensive lineman William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry was tackled (and technically sacked) for a 1-yard loss while trying to throw his first NFL pass on a halfback option play. On the Patriots' ensuing drive, Dent forced running back Craig James to fumble, which was recovered by Singletary at the 13-yard line. Two plays later, Bears fullback Matt Suhey scored on an 11-yard touchdown run to increase the lead to 13–3. New England took the ensuing kickoff and ran one play before the first quarter ended, which resulted in positive yardage for the first time in the game (a 3-yard run by James).

After an incomplete pass and a 4-yard loss, the Patriots had to send in punter Rich Camarillo again, and receiver Keith Ortego returned the ball 12 yards to the 41-yard line. The Bears subsequently drove 59 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 24-yard reception by Suhey, to score on McMahon's 2-yard touchdown run to increase their lead, 20–3. After the ensuing kickoff, New England lost 13 yards in 3 plays and had to punt again, but got the ball back with great field position when defensive back Raymond Clayborn recovered a fumble from Suhey at their own 46-yard line. On the punt, Ortego forgot what the play call was for the punt return, and the ensuing chaos resulted in him being penalized for running after a fair catch and teammate Leslie Frazier suffering a knee injury, which ended his career.

Patriots head coach Raymond Berry then replaced Eason with Steve Grogan, who had spent the previous week hoping he would have the opportunity to step onto the NFL's biggest stage. ""I probably won't get a chance"", he had told reporters a few days before the game. ""I just hope I can figure out some way to get on the field. I could come in on the punt-block team and stand behind the line and wave my arms, or something."" But on his first drive, Grogan could only lead them to the 37-yard line, and they decided to punt rather than risk a 55-yard field goal attempt. The Bears then marched 72 yards in 11 plays, moving the ball inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. New England kept them out of the end zone, but Butler kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half to give Chicago a 23–3 halftime lead.

The end of the first half was controversial. With 21 seconds left, McMahon scrambled to the Patriots' 3-yard line and was stopped inbounds. With the clock ticking down, players from both teams were fighting, and the Bears were forced to snap the ball before the officials formally put it back into play, allowing McMahon to throw the ball out of bounds and stop the clock with three seconds left. The Bears were penalized five yards for delay of game, but according to NFL rules, 10 seconds should have also been run off the clock during such a deliberate clock-stopping attempt in the final two minutes of a half. In addition, a flag should have been thrown for fighting (also according to NFL rules). This would have likely resulted in offsetting penalties, which would still allow for a field goal attempt. Meanwhile, the non-call on the illegal snap was promptly acknowledged by the officials and reported by NBC sportscasters during halftime, but the resulting three points were not taken away from the Bears (because of this instance, the NFL instructed officials to strictly enforce the 10-second run-off rule at the start of the 1986 season).

The Bears had dominated New England in the first half, holding them to 21 offensive plays (only four of which resulted in positive yardage), −19 total offensive yards, two pass completions, one first down, and 3 points. While Eason was in the game, the totals were six possessions, one play of positive yardage out of 15 plays, no first downs, 3 points, 3 punts, 2 turnovers, no pass completions, and -36 yards of total offense. Meanwhile, Chicago gained 236 yards and scored 23 points themselves.

After the Patriots received the second-half kickoff, they managed to get one first down, but then had to punt after Grogan was sacked twice. Camarillo, who punted four times in the first half, managed to pin the Bears back at their own 4-yard line with a then-Super Bowl record 62-yard punt. But the Patriots' defense still had no ability to stop Chicago's offense. On their very first play, McMahon faked a handoff to Payton, then threw a 60-yard completion to Gault. Eight plays later, McMahon finished the Super Bowl-record 96-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to increase the Bears' lead to 30–3. On New England's second drive of the quarter, Chicago cornerback Reggie Phillips (who replaced Frazier) intercepted a pass from Grogan and returned it 28 yards for a touchdown to increase the lead to 37–3.

On the second play of their ensuing possession, the Patriots turned the ball over again, when receiver Cedric Jones lost a fumble after catching a 19-yard pass from Grogan, and Wilber Marshall returned the fumble 13 yards to New England's 37-yard line. A few plays later, McMahon's 27-yard completion to receiver Dennis Gentry moved the ball to the 1-yard line, setting up perhaps the most memorable moment of the game. William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry was brought on to score on offense, as he had done twice in the regular season. His touchdown (while running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew in the process) made the score 44–3. The Bears' 21 points in the third quarter is still a record for the most points scored in that period, and their 41-point lead remains the record for widest margin after three quarters in a Super Bowl.

The Patriots finally scored a touchdown early in the fourth quarter, advancing the ball 76 yards in 12 plays and scoring on an 8-yard fourth-down pass from Grogan to receiver Irving Fryar. But the Bears' defense dominated New England for the rest of the game, forcing another fumble, another interception, and defensive lineman Henry Waechter's sack on Grogan in the end zone for a safety to make the final score 46–10.

386,What if the Philadelphia Eagles 2010 Draft was the best ever?,"February 4th, 2018. 2:16 on the clock. Tom Brady has the ball, down by 5 in the Super Bowl, and needing to drive 67 yards to score a game winning touchdown. This is a movie we've all seen before.

Until Brandon Graham stripped the ball from Brady's hands, leading to a Derek Barnett recovery, and ultimately an Eagles win. And finally, with this incredible play, Eagles fans everywhere could finally stop saying it.

&gt;""They should have picked Earl Thomas""

As cathartic as it was to watch BG recover from a rough start to his career, grow into a solid edge rusher and deliver the Super Bowl's most important play (maybe?, it was a wild game), let's be honest. They, uh, definitely should have taken Earl Thomas right? 

And not only that, the Eagles probably should have picked someone else nearly every time they were on the clock on April 22nd, 2010 at Radio City Music Hall. This is a remarkable feat considering they had ***13*** selections in the draft.

The record for picks in a single draft is the Miami Dolphins 14 choices in 1994. 7 times, a team has had 13 picks, the 2010 Eagles being the most recent. And what did they get with this haul of college prospects, 8 of them coming in the first 135 picks (or R5P3)? Well, Brandon Graham and not much else, the only player still active is Kurt Coleman, and the player who gave the most value to the eagles after BG was wide receiver and country music concert standout, Riley Cooper. Howie Roseman has since proven himself to be an actual wizard, and generally awesome dude who I love, but this first draft of his left something to be desired.

But what **could** the Eagles have gotten? The answer is the best NFL draft class of all time. Since it has been 10 years and we can accurately evaluate the careers of this class, and because the Eagles won that ring and their failures can no longer make me scream into the void, desperately longing for happiness, its time to see what could have been.

Here are the rules:

- We can only select a player who was on the board at the time of the Eagles pick, and drafted before their next pick. This means no Ndamukong Suh or Eric Berry - gone before R1P13. It also means we can't take Antonio Brown instead Daniel Te'o-Nesheim in the third round, since the Birds had 6 more picks between the two

- That's it that's the only rule

So here we go:

- Round 1, Pick 13: **Earl Thomas** instead of **Brandon Graham**, let's move on

- Round 2, Pick 5: The Birds picked **Nate Allen** here, who would play 100 games in the NFL for the Eagles, Raiders and Dolphins. Not bad for an average 2nd rounder, but Philly had some other options here. TJ Ward at the very next pick had a similar career, Koa Misi, Linval Joseph, or Carlos Dunlap are all solid picks. But, the choice is obvious, because 5 picks later **Rob Gronkowski** would go the Patriots. Andy, c'mon man, I know you have Brent Celek, but pull the trigger! But, like the Gronk way not the Aaron Hernandez way. Cool, cool, cool.

- Round 3, Pick 22: I mentioned **Daniel Te'o-Nesheim** above, and that's who the Eagles picked here. He started 2 games in a 4 year career. Sticking with the theme, we're sliding back 5 picks here and nabbing **NaVorro Bowman**, who immediately starts in an Eagles linebacking unit that was a sore spot following Jeremiah Trotter's departure.

- Round 4, Pick 7: **Trevard Lindley** made only 18 tackles in his lone NFL season. **Geno Atkins** has made and continues to make considerably more. He rotates with Broderick Bunkley and Mike Patterson his first couple of seasons and then terrorizes pockets with Fletcher Cox for half a decade. What fun!

- Round 4, Picks 23, 24, 27: So here's where I had to make an exception to my rule. The Eagles made 3 out of 5 selections in the back part of Rd 4, so there weren't many options to consider. So what I decided was, since the Eagles made 3 picks between 121 and 133 overall, we will do the same. Instead of **Keenan Clayton, Mike Kafka, and Clay Harbor**, we'll snag **Al Woods** and **O'Brien Schofield** - two rotational d-line players who had solid careers - and **Kam Chancellor** who is, well, **Kam Chancellor**.

- Round 5, Pick 3: **Ricky Sapp** didn't make the team out of camp, and would resurface in 2012 with the New York Jets after some practice squad time. He recovered 1 fumble in 17 games played over 3 seasons in NY and Houston. Two picks later is **Kendrick Lewis** who has been a starter for 6 years at safety for 3 different teams, fine value for a 5th round choice.

- Round 5, Pick 28: Aforementioned Kenny Chesney enthusiast **Riley Cooper** produced as much as you could reasonably hope a 5th rounder would at wide receiver. But just imagine if the Eagles instead picked a different pass catcher, who was way less racist, way bigger chested, and 100% **Antonio Brown**.

- Round 6, Pick 31: **Charles Scott** never played in the NFL. **Ted Larsen** is still getting starts at Center in Miami.

- Round 7: The Eagles knocked it out of the park in the 7th round, and even in this exercise still pick **Jamar Chaney** and **Kurt Coleman**, though they do go with **Robert McClain** instead of **Jeff Owens**.

So let's slap a table together here to see the final haul:



Player | Games | All Pros | Pro Bowls | Years Starter
------|-----|--------|---------|-------------
Earl Thomas | 125 | 3 | 6 | 8
Rob Gronkowski | 115 | 4 | 5 | 7
NaVorro Bowman | 99 | 4 | 3 | 5
Geno Atkins | 137 | 2 | 7 | 8
Al Woods | 111 | 0 | 0 | 3
O'Brien Schofield | 84 | 0 | 0 | 2
Kam Chancellor | 109 | 0 | 4 | 7
Kendrick Lewis | 103 | 0 | 0 | 6
Antonio Brown | 130 | 4 | 7 | 7
Ted Larsen | 125 | 0 | 0 | 6
Jamar Chaney | 54 | 0 | 0 | 1
Kurt Coleman | 132 | 0 | 0 | 6
Robert McClain | 94 | 0 | 0 | 0

The Eagles could have left the 2010 draft with 13 players, you know 25% of a roster, who could make and contribute to an NFL team. The first 4 picks would all be future All-Pros, 1 at each level of the defense, plus Gronk. Kam Chancellor has apparently never been an All-Pro, but AB makes it 5 anyway. And, between actual draft picks and UDFAs, the 2010 Eagles carried 15 rookies, so there is actually room to put all 13 of these guys onto a roster that went 10-6 without actually getting much out of those 15 rookies. And the furthest down the board we went in those first 4 picks was 15 slots to get Geno Atkins. Honestly, besides plummeting 36 spots to get AB instead of Cooper, none of these changes are too crazy. This pretty much could have happened, or at least partially happened, and instead the Eagles struck out on their 12 picks after Graham (though the Allen, Cooper, and Coleman picks were solid given the average output you get from those draft positions on average). 

Could the Greatest Draft Class of All-Time have reinvigorated the Andy Reid era? Does it get him over the hump?

Does GM and certified wizard Howie Roseman find a way to navigate the ridiculous 2014 offseason when, even after taking Thomas's 5th-year option, he has at least 7 and as many as 12 players with rookie contracts ending who deserve roster spots?

It's possible they could be just throwing the first few games to see what actually works and then fixing it for the rest of the season. Or if could just be coincidence like if Alabama loses that year.

Just seems strange such a good team seems to get off to a slow start and be dominated early in the season in embarrassing losses that make people wonder if ""this is the year"" the Patriots will finally be trash.",nfl,JudgerMan123,29,2019-08-02
395,My proposal for Bye Weeks,"Teams and fans alike seem to have issues with some of the Bye Weeks that they are given. The NFL keeps having this issue without ever attempting to find a remedy. Here’s a way I’ve concocted to even the playing field AND add a little excitement to the mid-season. 

Week 8 - One conference takes the entire week off. Let’s say the AFC won the SuperBowl so they get week 8 off. So this means the NFC will have a rivalry week with only division games being played. Last season’s 1 seed (home) plays last season’s 4 seed (away) and the 2 (home) plays the 3 (away). 

Week 9 - Flip it. All of the NFC now gets a Bye Week and the AFC does their rivalry week. 

This gives every team an even playing field and builds to two straight weeks of intense rivalry games.

408,"How would you score a ""pick 'em"" contest for NFL if you could get creative?","I'm going to host a new ""pick 'em"" style contest this upcoming season (across sports - weekly for the NFL, maybe half weekly for NBA and NHL). For the NFL, how would you ideally set up the scoring? Reddit awards to be given out.

The contest will allow you to submit your picks in various formats:

\- Projected winner

\- Point differential / spread (implies projected winner)

\- Score (implies projected winner AND point differential)

\- Odds for who will win (implies projected winner)

You will be able to update picks up until the actual game start.

We have several levers here - so for example, 100 points for right exact score or spread? 50 points for getting winner right, -50 points for getting it wrong? Bonus points for projections made 5 days before vs. 1 day before (so you get more credit for picking the winner a week before vs someone who picks the winner the day before when you have more information)?

418,"What if The Titans got ""the Yard?""- An alt-history scenario","Alternate History, anyone?

It's a well known fact that on January 30th, 2000, the Tennessee Titans were one yard away from sending Super Bowl 34 into overtime, and possibly winning the game outright. Instead, receiver Kevin Dyson was tackled just short of the goal line by Mike Jones on the game's last play, solidifying two legacies: a Rams football dynasty, and a Titans dynasty that never was.

What if I told you...the Titans got that yard, and won the game in overtime? How would each team fare?

&amp;#x200B;

**Tennessee Titans**

First off, the Titans. Their change is the most obvious. Jeff Fisher wins the Super Bowl in just his 6th year as Head coach, and seeing how agonizingly long the Titans actually kept him in real life, he will have many more years to go. Playmakers on the team such as Steve McNair, Kevin Dyson and Eddie George still have three or four playing years ahead of them, and they might even push themselves to play more after a SB victory. So, the team is in good condition heading into the near future. This is in stark contrast to the Rams in our timeline, whose team fell apart a few years after their win.

In the early 2000's, the AFC is mostly a battle between Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Oakland. Three will go on to win Super Bowls. The Titans win two more Super Bowls, in 2001 and 2003, both against the Eagles. With 3 Super Bowls under his belt, Jeff Fisher is seen as one of the all-time great coaches in the NFL, and the Titans' legacy is solidified as one of the best teams ever.

Past the early 2000's, however, the Titans are defined by early playoff losses and average seasons, which Jeff Fisher is most known for (on top of his rings.)

**St. Louis Rams**

The ""Above-average show on Turf"" is a sad story of getting so close, yet being so far.

There is no doubt that, despite losing the SB, Kurt Warner returns the next season as the starting quarterback. He will continue to have a solid career, but never be able to win the big game. The Rams suffer playoff losses in the 2000 and 2001 seasons, and following an abyssmal 2002 season Warner is traded. Coach Dick Vermeil retires with the departure of Warner. The Rams pick up Byron Leftwich from the draft and are a mostly irrelevant franchise into the foreseeable future. Just like Warner and Vermeil, the Rams' legacy will be the team that was so close to glory, but never quite made it.

**New England Patriots and the AFC East**

After a brutal injury in Week 2, backup Tom Brady takes over for the Patriots' QB position in 2001. He posts solid numbers during the regular season, and some even speculate he could replace Bledsoe. New England enters the Playoffs as a 3 seed, behind the Steelers and Titans. They beat Baltimore in the first round, but fall to the Titans after.

The next season will be mired with controversy, as the Team cannot decide whether to start Bledsoe or Brady. They choose Bledsoe, considered the safe option, and trade Tom Brady to the Buffalo Bills.

The Bills find new life under Tom Brady, and for many years the division is extremely competitive between them. The Patriots will defeat the New York Giants for the first, and only, Super Bowl in 2007, while Brady and the Bills don't win any. Sorry Bills, your suffering is inescapable.

**The Rest of the AFC**

If the Titans are the dominant AFC team of this era, then a close runner-up is Baltimore, whose defense consistently proves a challenge for Jeff Fisher's questionable play calling. They win the SB in 2000 and remain competitive for many seasons to come.

Oakland defeats the Titans in a shocking upset in 2002, but falls apart in an upset loss to Tampa in the Super Bowl. Many believe their best chance was in 2001, when a controversial call ruled that Steve McNair had not fumbled the football late in the game. This established the ""tuck rule.""

Pittsburgh takes longer to find their stride, but defeats Kurt Warner and the Cardinals in 2008, and is a competitive team throughout the decade.

**The Rest of the NFC**

Without the Rams, it seems likely the dominant team would be McNabb and the Eagles. There are two McNair-McNabb Super Bowls, both of which go to the Titans. Andy Reid and the Eagles grow more frustrated with these losses, and by 2008, they have all but flamed out. Egos run high and the team seems cursed when it comes to winning important games.

The New York Giants take over the NFC East in the late 2000's, and win one super Bowl against a 16-0 Bills team that many considered was vastly superior.

Phillip Rivers brings a long-suffering Saints franchise their first ever Super Bowl title after the deadly Hurricane Katrina.

**Conclusion**

Jeff Fisher is often made fun of for his 8-8 seasons and terrible play calling, and rightfully so. But it's interesting to think how close he was to forming a dynasty team and cementing a legacy. He would never have an opportunity like it again, and would forever be average, a footnote in NFL history. The Rams took that glory, but when the team was broken up shortly after the victory, it opened the door for the Brady and the Patriots to dominate the NFL for decades. Only one yard could have changed all that.",nfl,kahootmusicfor10hour,16,2019-08-02

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Minnesota Vikings.**

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The first thing I always do when constructing the offense is look to see the QB situation, and whether or not I have to burn a first round pick on one. Turns out, with this team, I don’t. The best QB in franchise history is Fran Tarkenton, and he was only a third round pick, so placing him in the round three spot was an easy call and gives this team a huge advantage. Now, if you’ve followed this series, you’d think that the next step is to put in the Hall of Fame players, and to use the first round spot on one of these guys, whether that be Randall McDaniel, Ron Yary, or Randy Moss. However, there was a problem when I looked at this roster. Every halfback that’s been good for the Vikings that was drafted by the team was a first round pick. If I went with a guy like Randy Moss in the first round, I would have no good options at halfback whatsoever. Because of this, Peterson was the play in the first round; plus, I’d imagine that he’s going to be in the Hall of Fame someday, so it’s not like this is a massive downgrade from someone currently in the Hall.

With that out of the way, it was time to put in the positions where my hands were tied, and where there was no other comparable option. This meant putting Stefon Diggs in the round five spot at wide receiver, Matt Birk in the round six spot on the offensive line, Steve Jordan in the 7+ spot at tight end, and Paul Flatley at wide receiver in the round four spot. With that, I had one spot open, and it had to be an offensive lineman, so Ed White was the choice there, as he was the best offensive lineman available (and probably the best second round pick on offense in franchise history as well).

**Defense:** The Vikings drafted three Hall of Fame players that ended up playing for them. All three of those guys were on the defensive line, with the clear standout of the bunch being Alan Page. Therefore, that made my life pretty easy, knowing what position to use in that first round spot. After that, it was about plugging in the obvious picks. This meant Matt Blair at linebacker in round two, Henry Thomas on the defensive line in round three, and Todd Scott at defensive back in round six.

With three rounds to go, there were so many different combinations I could’ve used. I could’ve used Everson Griffen on the defensive line in round four and Ed McDaniel at linebacker in round five. I could’ve used the seventh round spot at defensive back on Carl Lee instead of Bobby Bryant. I could’ve used Scott Studwell at linebacker in the 7+ spot and played with three linebackers (or two linebackers and Everson Griffen in round four) instead of three defensive backs. The possibilities with this team truly are endless, and if you’re into this series, I encourage you to play around with the defense, because there were tons of different combinations that I was going through when putting this one together.

**Final Thoughts**

This is a really well balanced team that has a decent shot to win some games in the tournament. On offense, they have a Hall of Fame quarterback, a future Hall of Fame halfback, and some really good pieces at wide receiver and on the offensive line. The worst player on this offense might be Stefon Diggs, which is saying something about how good the offense is. And, defensively, there’s a lot to like about this team, as they don’t have too many weaknesses. Any defensive line led by Alan Page is going to be good, and though the secondary might not be flashy compared to teams like the Lions, it’s still pretty solid. Don’t be surprised if this team wins a game or two when the time comes.

432,[OC] Slightly Deeper than Surface Look into why each team in this division will overperform or underperform AFC South Edition.,"I did this not too long ago for AFC west here https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/cbwsb7/oc_a_surface_look_into_why_each_team_will_be/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

Now I will take a look into the AFC South

Houston Texans:

Last year they won The division after a horrendous start but proved they could be a team to reckoned with in the middle of the season. 

Overperform: Losing Coutee and will Fuller to injuries for the majority of the year made NuK basically have to carry the load for the team for receiving. Getting these to WR back should allow watson to truly show his true potential this season. 

Underperform: Question Marks at the GM position lead to uncertainty with Clowney, Playing through a first place schedule and having the jags presumably being atleast moderately better than last year should make things harder this year.

**Colts**:

OverPerform: Dearest Wife, The new Recruits Flourished in their first Year of battle, Both Earning The highest Honors in their field. My Injury has fully healed and I am ready to have a full year of training with the men. My Trusty Sgt Doyle has also come back from medical. 

UnderPerform: The colts Scraped by with alot of victories against bad teams. they only had 2 wins against playoff teams last year (well 3 if you count the playoff win). Cowboys and Texans. Ebron had the best year of his career and the young defense performed signifcantly above expectations. it would not be surprising if they stepped back and having to play the NFCSouth and AFCWest doenst make things any easier.

**Titans**

OverPerform: this could be the year their QB finally steps up... that could be about Tannehill or Mariota, both of them are playing for contracts. Signing Saffold could legitimately bolster their line and maybe keep them alive back their to actually throw it out. This team is likely a run first team again but having good oline play could help alot. Their Defense is actually very Stout and would not be surprised to see it step up even more led by probowler DT Casey.

UnderPerform: Like i said, both QB's are in contract years, they are not signed long term for a reason. If things are going poorly it could be a revolving door at the Qb spot and that spells disaster and a 1st round pick in the top 5 in a division that could be putting out some serious Pain on the defensive side of the ball. Slightly Deeper level, If you take away that one game in Jacksonville Derrick henry averaged only 4.1 Y/A and only 55YPG which isn't all that great for the teams feature back.

**JAGS**

OverPerform: The jags last year were probably the most severe underperformers of the season, from being a penalty away from the superbowl to eliminated from the playoffs before week 15. Getting Nick foles could lead to some serious development instead of rotating between Bortles and Kessler, WR dede Westbrook can get some development as he has shown to be a nice player when given the oppurtunity.. The defense should come back strong with Ramsey appearing to care more about football than talking shit this offseason, dude wants to get Paid, so Expect a good year out of him and the rest of his team.

Underperform: Nick Foles Magic happens in the post season, and apart from 27-2 season he has not shown much in the regular season as the starting QB, He is probably an upgrade but maybe not the savior. Fournette was taken top 5 and apart from 8 games his rookie year hasn't really proved why, between injuries, off the field and on the field antics and general underperformance its possible this man is traded halfway through the year for a mediocre pick just to get something from him. 



Overall I think It this division could be very solid and Colts Could make their push to Superbowl contention this year but they significantly overperformed expectations last year so expecting them to do it twice is a little much. The titans could have some severe issues on offense that their defense might not be able to cover up. The Texans have front office turmoil so winning must happen to not just have it all blown up i dont think they can afford to start 0-3 again, and the Jags are gonna live or Die by Foles magic.

6. Int Luck - DVOA's Expected interception rate minus the actual INT rate for that QB. Expected interceptions are total INTs + dropped INTs - hail mary INTs - tip drill INTs. A high number means your QB should have had more INTs than they did and visa-versa. I used rates instead of totals since not all QBs played 16 games. https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2019/adjusted-interceptions-2018

7. Takeaways - Total takeaways by a defense. I view these as correlated to defensive strength but not stable year over year. For instance the Jags (33 takeaways) and Ravens (34 takeaways) led in 2017 but both ended 2018 with 17 takeaways despite fielding strong defenses. https://www.footballdb.com/stats/turnovers.html?yr=2017&amp;conf=&amp;sort=taketot

452,"Would it be a reasonable strategy for a team to draft a QB (or multiple until one hits), run with him throughout his rookie contract, sell him for an insane amount of picks, and repeat the process instead of paying market value for a good QB?","Outside of Brady and the Pats, it’s become a trend to draft a QB high in the draft, build a team of other high picks and valuable veterans around him, and go win-now mode while the QB is cheap on his rookie contract. The Browns, Chiefs, Rams, Bears, Jets, maybe Cardinals, and possibly a few others I’m forgetting have been pushing to establish their squads and hoping their young QBs pan out.

But what happens when you need to pay that QB? And how much more will he demand if you succeed in winning a championship?

There have already been rumors of Mahomes possibly becoming the first $200m contract in NFL history and he’s not even halfway through his rookie deal. The Browns with all their high picks are going to be strapped for cash in a few years if Mayfield, Ward, Garrett, and maybe Chubb and Njoku play at a high level. The Rams have been selling picks like crazy to go for it all with Goff.

I just wonder: Would it be reasonable (or even maybe smarter) to trade these young studs at the end of their rookie deals in an attempt to amass draft capital and repeat the process as opposed to resetting the QB market and having little cap room to organize a decent roster?

And as a Browns fan, I feel I have to clarify this. I know finding a stud QB straight out of college isn’t easy. However, the Browns haven’t drafted a QB in the top 10 before Baker since Tim Couch. With a shitload of draft capital from trading away a franchise QB, the team in question could very well trade up or draft a QB every year until they hit on the next stud.

**Division: NFC East (10-6, 1st)**

Season result: Lost to Rams in divisional round, 30-22

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone!  u/BurningFoldingTable here, and this is the non-fan offseason review post for the Dallas Cowboys.  Even though Dallas is probably my second or third favorite team, I like to think that I am not very biased one way or the other in my assessment of the team.  Also, I just want to quickly note that this is the first big post I have ever done on Reddit, so if you have any criticism feel free to let me know in the comments!

&amp;#x200B;

The 2018 Dallas Cowboys had a strong season, making it all the way to the divisional round, and losing to the eventual NFC Super Bowl representative.  They had a slow start at 3-5, but were able to finish the season strong, going 7-1 in their final 8 games.  By doing this, they dethroned the reigning Super Bowl champions to win the NFC East, keeping the recent tradition of no repeat champions in their division alive.  Going into next season, the Cowboys are expecting big things.  With many star players in contract years, this year seems like a very important year for the Cowboys to succeed in, and I think that after this offseason, they can potentially do big things this year.  Now with that out of the way, time to get into the actual *offseason* review.

480,If The 100th NFL Season Had Every Franchise's First Team Name,"Since this will be a milestone year for the NFL(100th season), I figured I would go back, and see the original name of each franchise, and what they used to go by. Of course, it's not as fun for the newer franchises(sorry Texans fans). Here is what our divisions would look like if every team went by their original first name in their *franchise history*. Also, pay attention to the different locations of each team.

I didn't list these in any particular order by the way.

AFC East

**Boston Patriots**

**Miami Dolphins**

**Buffalo Bills**

**New York Titans**

AFC North

**Pittsburgh Pirates**

**Baltimore Ravens(*no, they were never the Browns, get over it*)**

**Cincinnati Bengals**

**Cleveland Browns**

AFC South

**Baltimore Colts**

**Houston Texans**

**Houston Oilers**

**Jacksonville Jaguars**

AFC West

**Dallas Texans**

**Los Angeles Chargers(*believe it, or not*)**

**Denver Broncos** 

**Oakland Raiders**

NFC East

**New York Giants**

**Philadelphia Eagles**

**Dallas Cowboys**

**Boston Braves**

NFC North

**Green Bay Packers**

**Decatur Staleys**

**Portsmouth Spartans**

**Minnesota Vikings**

NFC South

**Carolina Panthers**

**Atlanta Falcons**

**New Orleans**

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

NFC West

**Chicago Cardinals**

**Cleveland Rams**

**San Francisco 49ers**

**Seattle Seahawks**

The NFC South is the only division that wouldn't change.

The Green Bay Packers are the longest franchise running franchise to solely have one team name, and they're also the oldest franchise to solely have one team name. They were established in 1919.

481,Return Trips to Conference Championship Games,"Back-to-back trips to the Super Bowl are exceedingly rare. Since realignment, only the Patriots (03-04, 16-17-18) and the Seahawks (13-14) have accomplished it. Getting to consecutive Conference Championship Games should be a little bit easier, right? Obviously the Patriots have gone to the AFCCG the last eight seasons, we all know that. But how difficult is it for “normal” teams to make it back-to-back?

The last team other than the Patriots to do it was the Seahawks. They made the 2013 NFCCG, winning both that game and the Super Bowl. They returned to the 2014 NFCCG, winning again, but went on to lose the Super Bowl. 

They didn’t make it back after that though, because overcoming the “Super Bowl hangover” is pretty darn difficult. The last team to accomplish *that* was the 49ers, who won the 2012 NFCCG, lost the 2012 SB, and returned to the 2013 NFCCG (to lose). 

The last team to lose the *CCG* and make it back next year? Also the 49ers! Tied with the Ravens, as each team lost its CCG after the 2011 season, but returned to the game the following season — and both won, facing off in the infamous Harbaugh Bowl. 

For good measure: the last non-Harbaugh-brother-coached CCG to make it back? The Jets, who lost the AFCCG in both the 2009 and 2010 seasons. 

Other than those cases (and the Patriots), the only other back-to-back CCG appearance are:

* Steelers losing the 2004 AFCCG, then winning the 2005 AFCCG and SB
* Eagles losing the 2002 NFCCG, then losing the 2003 NFCCG, then winning the 2004 NFCCG (but losing the SB)

Elite quarterbacks (Manning, Rodgers, Ben) seem to make a CCG roughly every three years, though Brees is the unfortunate exception here (every six years for him, thanks to those garbage defenses). 

Elite defenses, on the other hand, tend to be the cause of repeat/streaky appearances — even for elite quarterbacks. This is a commonality shared by every repeat. So even if defense may now always win championships, it certainly gets you there in this league.",nfl,dickandborty,29,2019-08-02

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Washington Redskins.**

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** Right off the bat, I had a dilemma with this team. The first instinct is to put Sammy Baugh in the first round spot at quarterback, because he’s a Hall of Famer and he’s really good. However, when I did this, I looked at who he had to throw the ball to… and there was nobody of note. It would be Sammy Baugh surrounded by a cast of nobodies in terms of the skill positions. So, even though Baugh is clearly the greatest quarterback in franchise history, I had to exclude him from this team because of the nature of this series. Instead, I slotted Mark Rypien in the sixth round spot, and gave him Charley Taylor to throw the ball to (although you could make a case for Art Monk).

Now with that out of the way, I looked at the rounds where my hands were tied, and where I had no other option but the player in question. Russ Grimm in round three seemed like an obvious play, as did Jim Schrader in round two. The core of the offensive line was now out of the way with those two players. In round five, there were only a few noteworthy players, with those guys being Dick Todd and Mike Thomas. I went with Todd since he offers more versatility and can be used as both a halfback and a receiver.

Two rounds to go, and I need a halfback and an OL/TE hybrid. There were two combinations that I was thinking of with the fourth and seventh round spots. One of them was the one that I ended up going with, and that was Stephen Davis at halfback and Len Hauss on the offensive line. The other combination was to put Vince Promuto in the round four offensive line spot, and then use Larry Brown, the MVP of the league in 1972 at halfback in the 7+ spot. In the end, I opted for the first combination, just because the drop-off from Brown to Davis was less than the drop-off from Hauss to Promuto, but I could easily see the argument for going with the Brown/Promuto combination. If enough people want me to flip that, I have no problem doing so.

**Defense:** The first order of business was to put the Hall of Famers in the team. I opted for Darrell Green over Champ Bailey since I’m only looking at what they did with their team; Bailey’s best years came in Denver, while Green played close to 300 games with Washington, so while both are worthy players, Green got the nod in the secondary there. For the second round, Paul Krause got the spot, making this secondary absolutely stacked. And, in the 7+ spot, I had to put the nine-time Pro Bowler and Hall of Fame linebacker in there. Three Hall of Famers on this team is not too shabby.

Now, it’s time to round out the rest of the team. I started by looking at the rounds where my hands were tied. In the third round, Charles Mann was the obvious play, and in round five, there was no other good option besides Dexter Manley. Two spots to go, and I need a linebacker and a joker. The only good play in round six was Harold McLinton at linebacker, so for the fourth round spot, I had flexibility to go with any player on the board. In the end, I went with Perry Riley, though you could go with someone else like Bashaud Breeland or Ralph Felton; personally, I felt as though the linebackers needed a third body more than a secondary with Green and Krause needed a third body, so Riley was the play here.

**Final Thoughts**

There’s some quality talent on this team. Any secondary that contains Darrell Green and Paul Krause is going to be hard to beat; combined with a very solid defensive front consisting of a Hall of Fame linebacker and some good players in Dexter Manley and Charles Mann, and you’ve got a team that’s going to be tough to score on. Offensively, Mark Rypien isn’t great, but being able to throw to one of the best receivers in NFL history from the pre-merger era helps, and having a great offensive line led by Russ Grimm definitely helps. This team should be able to take at least a game in this tournament when the time comes.

46,[Serious] How not paying RBs will fundamentally change the game of football,"It's been the topic of discussion for the past decade: are RB's as valuable as they once were?

&amp;#x200B;

The answer is overwhelmingly - no.

&amp;#x200B;

This has caused teams to not only slow down on drafting RB's in the first or second round, but also not re-sign them to longterm contracts. This is due to the fact that RB's have ever increasingly short shelf lives, and the fact that teams like the Patriots have shown that if you have a sturdy offensive line &amp; quarterback, you can plug &amp; play.

&amp;#x200B;

Players like Peyton Manning and Drew Brees have also demonstrated that you can win a Super Bowl off the shoulders of an elite QB with a committee of RB's. All in all, this has caused passing statistics to far outpace rushing statistics. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this marquee time of both Zeke and Melvin holding out, seeing how Bell got what he wanted in doing so, I think the younger generation of today is going to see this and start to switch to a wide receiving position (WR/TE) or go to defense. (LB/CB/S)

&amp;#x200B;

The days of running the ball 40+ a game will slowly dwindle as talent slowly lessens. This will cause for less injuries as less contact will be made with running the ball less, which is a good thing for the sustaining power of the NFL. I can see teams who get in front of this by not signing large contracts to RBs and instead focus on offensive line and passing will be the ones who find offensive success in the 20's.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this movement, and if we will continue to see dwindling RB stars in the NFL.",nfl,Windberry,69,2019-07-17

52,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 51)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 51: 1970 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 18, 1970-January 17, 1971

Teams: 26 (Merged 16 from the NFL, 10 from the AFL)

1970 NFL Draft: 442 selections (17 rounds), held in New York City, NY.

1970 First Draft Pick: Terry Bradshaw, Quarterback from Louisiana Tech University (Pittburgh Steelers)

1970 AP Most Valuable Player: John Brodie, Quarterback (San Francisco 49ers)

Super Bowl V: Baltimore Colts (AFC) defeated Dallas Cowboys (NFC) 16-13 at the Orange Bowl in Miami, FL.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The stadium's scoreboard clock became the official game clock.

\-The practice of having the players' last names added to the backs of their jerseys became universal. The old NFL teams did not have names on the back prior to this season, whereas the AFL teams did.

The 1970 NFL Season featured the largest expansion they had seen with the merger of the NFL and AFL as agreed upon a few years earlier. With it, the league grew to 26 teams, each divided into 6 divisions among 2 conferences, the NFC and AFC. The divisions were as follows:

**-NFC East:** Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington Redskins

\-**NFC Central:** Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings

\-**NFC West:** Atlanta Falcons, Los Angeles Rams, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers

\-**AFC East:** Baltimore Colts, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Boston Patriots, New York Jets

\-**AFC Central:** Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Houston Oilers, Pittsburgh Steelers

\-**AFC West:** Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs, Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers

This arrangement would keep most of the pre-merger NFL teams in the NFC and the AFL teams in the AFC. Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Baltimore were placed in the AFC in order to balance it out, while the NFC equalized the competitive strength of its East and West divisions rather than sorting out teams just geographically. The 26-team league began to use an 8-team playoff format, 4 from each conference, that included the 3 division winners and a wild card team, the 2nd-place team with the best record.

The playoff qualifiers were (please note the wild card qualifiers\*):

**-NFC East:** Dallas Cowboys (10-4-0)

\-**NFC Central:** Minnesota Vikings (12-2-0), Detroit Lions (10-4-0)\*

\-**NFC West:** San Francisco 49ers (10-3-1)

\-**AFC East:** Baltimore Colts (11-2-1), Miami Dolphins (10-4-0)\*

\-**AFC Central:** Cincinnati Bengals (8-6-0)

\-**AFC West:** Oakland Raiders (8-4-2)

**Divisional Playoffs**

Baltimore Colts defeated Cincinnati Bengals 17-0 at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, MD.

Dallas Cowboys defeated Detroit Lions 5-0 at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, TX.

San Francisco 49ers defeated Minnesota Vikings 17-14 at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, MN.

Oakland Raiders defeated Miami Dolphins 21-14 at Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, CA.

**Conference Championships**

AFC Championship Game: Baltimore Colts defeated Oakland Raiders 27-17 at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, MD.

NFC Championship Game: Dallas Cowboys defeated San Francisco 49ers 17-10 at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, CA.

**Super Bowl V**

The Baltimore Colts and the Dallas Cowboys competed in Super Bowl V held in the Orange Bowl in Miami, FL. The attendance for the game was 79,204 while NBC broadcast the game. The Colts were favored by 2.5 points.

The first three possessions of Super Bowl V ended quietly with each team punting after a 3-and-out. Then, on the first play of the Colts' second drive, Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley intercepted a pass from Johnny Unitas and returned it 22 yards to the Colts' 46-yard line, the first of 11 combined turnovers committed by both teams. The Cowboys failed to take advantage of the turnover, with a 15-yard holding penalty 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage pushing them back to a 3rd-and-33 situation. Walt Garrison gained 11 yards and Dallas had to punt. However, Colts punt returner Ron Gardin muffed the return, and the loose ball was recovered by Cowboys safety Cliff Harris at the Colts' 9-yard line. The Cowboys were unable to score a touchdown and settled for kicker Mike Clark's 14-yard field goal to establish a 3–0 lead.

After a Colts punt which they failed to keep from reaching the end zone, Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton completed a 41-yard pass to Bob Hayes to reach the Colts' 12-yard line, with a roughing the passer penalty adding 6 yards (half the distance to the goal), but Dallas was denied the end zone by the Baltimore defense for a second time. Linebacker Ted Hendricks deflected Morton's pass on first down and running back Duane Thomas was tackled for a 1-yard loss on second down.

Morton committed a 15-yard intentional grounding penalty on third down to open the 2nd quarter, pushing the Cowboys back to the 22-yard line and forcing them to settle for Clark's 30-yard field goal, stretching the score to 6-0.

On their next possession the Colts offense got a break. After two straight incompletions to open the drive, Unitas uncorked a pass to Eddie Hinton that was both high and behind the receiver. The ball ricocheted off Hinton's hands, was tipped by Dallas defensive back Mel Renfro, then landed in the arms of tight end John Mackey, who sprinted 75 yards for a touchdown. The Cowboys subsequently blocked Jim O'Brien's extra point attempt to keep the score tied at 6-6, with O'Brien later saying that he was ""awfully nervous"" and hesitated a second too long before kicking it.

Six minutes into the second quarter, Cowboys linebacker Lee Roy Jordan tackled Unitas, causing him to fumble. Dallas recovered the loose ball at the Baltimore 28 and capitalized three plays later, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Morton to Thomas to establish a 13-6 lead. The next time the Colts had the ball they quickly turned it over yet again, with Unitas unleashing a fluttering interception to Renfro while being hit fiercely on a pass. Unitas was knocked out of the game permanently on the play with a rib injury and was replaced by Earl Morrall, who was widely blamed for the Colts loss in Super Bowl III. The Cowboys, starting from their own 15, were unable to score any points off the turnover. After sustaining a 15-yard pass interference penalty, they punted. After regaining possession, the Colts offense, led by Morrall, stormed all the way to the Cowboys 2-yard line with less than two minutes remaining in the half. However, the Cowboys defense stiffened. Colts running back Norm Bulaich was stuffed on three consecutive rushing attempts from inside the 2-yard line. On fourth down, Morrall threw an incomplete pass, turning the ball over on downs and ending the half with Dallas leading 13–6.

The second half was a parade of turnovers, sloppy play, penalties, and missed opportunities. Colts returner Jim Duncan fumbled the opening kickoff of the second half and Dallas recovered. Then the Cowboys drove to the Colts' 1-yard line, but Mike Curtis punched the ball loose from Cowboys running back Duane Thomas before crossing the end zone, and the Colts took over at the 1 as Duncan was credited with the recovery–-a controversial call because when the resulting pile-up was sorted out, Dallas center Dave Manders was holding the ball. The energized Colts then drove to the Cowboys' 44-yard line but came up empty when O'Brien's 52-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. However, instead of attempting to return the missed field goal, Renfro allowed it to bounce inside their own 1-yard line where it was downed by center Tom Goode (NFL rules prior to 1974 allowed a field goal that fell short of the goal posts to be downed just like a punt; that rule is still in effect in high school football).

Dallas, backed up to its own end zone, punted after three plays. The Colts would have received the ball inside Dallas territory following the punt, but a 15-yard clipping penalty pushed the Colts back to their own 39 to begin the drive. Two plays later, Morrall completed a 45-yard pass to running back Tom Nowatzke to reach the Cowboys 15-yard line.

Three plays later, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Morrall threw an interception to Howley in the end zone to preserve the Cowboys' 13-6 lead. After forcing the Cowboys to punt, the Colts regained the ball on their own 18-yard line, still trailing 13-6. Aided by a pass interference call and a 23-yard completion, the Colts advanced into Dallas territory. The Colts then attempted to fool the Cowboys with a flea-flicker, resulting in one of the oddest plays in Super Bowl history. Running back Sam Havrilak took a handoff and ran right, intending to lateral the ball back to Morrall, but Dallas lineman Jethro Pugh stormed into the backfield and prevented him from doing so. Havrilak then threw a pass intended for Mackey, but it was caught instead by Hinton, who promptly took off for the end zone. However, as Hinton raced toward a touchdown, Cowboys defensive back Cornell Green stripped him from behind at the 11. The loose ball bounced wildly in the field of play but somehow evaded recovery. It was eventually pushed 20 yards through the back of the end zone for a touchback, thus returning the ball to the Cowboys at their 20.

Three plays after the turnover the Cowboys returned the favor. Morton threw a pass that was intercepted by Colts safety Rick Volk, who returned the ball 30 yards to the Cowboys' 3. Two plays later, the Colts scored on a 2-yard touchdown run by Nowatzke. O'Brien's extra point sailed through the uprights to tie the game at 13–13. The next two possessions ended in traded punts, with the Cowboys eventually taking over in excellent field position at the Colts 48-yard line with less than two minutes left in the game.

On the second play of this potential game-winning drive, Dallas committed a 15-yard holding penalty (its second offensive holding of the game) on the 42-yard line, which was a spot foul, pushing the team all the way back to its own 27-yard line (the NFL did not reduce the penalty for offensive holding to 10 yards until 1974). Then, on second down and 35, Morton threw a pass that slipped through the hands of running back Dan Reeves and bounced for an interception into the arms of linebacker Mike Curtis, who then returned the ball 13 yards to the Cowboys' 28-yard line.

Two plays later, with 0:09 left in the game, O'Brien kicked the go ahead 32-yard field goal, giving Baltimore a 16–13 lead. The Cowboys received the ball again on their 40 with a few seconds remaining after O'Brien's ensuing squib kick, but Morton's pass to Garrison was intercepted by Logan at the Baltimore 29, and time expired, giving Baltimore the title.

The city of Baltimore wouldn't see another title until 30 years later in Super Bowl XXXV, they also won Super Bowl XLVII. The Colts however would relocate to Indianapolis and would appear in 2 Super Bowls, XLI (which they won) and XLIV. The Cowboys would appear in 7 more Super Bowls, winning 5 of them (VI, XII, XXVII, XVIII, XXX).

95,What if the 2017 Baltimore Ravens made the Playoffs?,"By week 17 of the 2017 NFL season, the Baltimore Ravens had, by far, the easiest path of anyone in the AFC when it came to making the playoffs. All Baltimore had to do was beat the Bengals at home and they would be in the playoffs. No help from anyone else needed, just beat up on a Bengals team that appeared to have given up on the season weeks ago. And Baltimore somehow, someway, couldn’t make that happen. Andy Dalton fired a laser to Tyler Boyd for an improbable touchdown on fourth-and-12 to setup the Bengals win. This brings up the question, what if that Bengals touchdown never happened and the Ravens made the playoffs that year? If the Ravens win that game, they’re locked into the 5th seed with a 10-6 record and would face the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round at Arrowhead. The Chiefs team that season definitely had some highs and lows, starting off the season 5-0, but then in the middle of the season, going 1-6. The Chiefs would finish strong, winning their last 4 games of the season, but were ultimately upset by the Titans in the Wild Card round 22-21. Would the Ravens have managed to beat that Chiefs team in the playoffs? Given how well Joe Flacco plays in the playoffs and how solid the Baltimore defense is (their defense ranked third in the league based on DVOA that season), I think Baltimore had a good shot at pulling off the upset against the Chiefs had they been in that position and advancing to the Divisional round.

99,"Kenyan Drake's career-long receiving touchdown is 52 yards, but his career-long reception is only 47 yards.","December 9, 2018, the Dolphins were down 28-33 to the Patriots, on their own 31-yard-line, with time for one last play before time expired. Ryan Tannehill completed a pass short right to Kenny Stills, who lateralled to DeVante Parker, who lateralled to Kenyan Drake for a the [game-winning 69-yard hook-and-ladder touchdown as time expired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jTXLc4xqag). 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I learned how yards are attributed on plays with laterals. The first player to carry or catch the ball gets credit for the attempt/reception and the yards he gained, while any subsequent player who touches the ball gets credit for any yards or touchdowns they gain or score on the play. However, a player who receives a lateral *does not receive credit for an attempt/reception.*

&amp;#x200B;

Drake was 52 yards from the endzone when he first touched the ball, so he gets credit for a 52-yard receiving touchdown -- and zero receptions on the play. His career-long receiving touchdown came on a play where he didn't catch the ball.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the [2018 NFL Guide for Statisticians (page 18):](http://www.nflgsis.com/gsis/documentation/stadiumguides/guide_for_statisticians.pdf)

&gt;Laterals subsequent to the originating play are considered as part of the play from which they originate. The receiver of a lateral is given credit for the yardage he gains from the point he receives the lateral BUT he is not given an attempt, return, or reception on the play. (See Exceptions listed under Kickoff Returns.) For example, a forward pass is completed and the receiver advances 40 yards, then laterals to a teammate who advances the ball an additional 20 yards. This is considered a 60-yard pass play. The first receiver is credited with the reception and 40 yards gained; his teammate, although not credited with a reception, would appear in the pass receiving section with 20 yards gained. If a touchdown is scored as a result of such a play, the player who scores shall be credited with a touchdown via receiving. In any case, the original play determines in what category the touchdown was made.",nfl,ToothpasteTimebomb,81,2019-07-17

However, he had a great end to the season plus the playoffs as he finally flashed the shutdown ability he displayed time and time again as a rookie. Going into an off-season healthy and motivated to prove he is a shutdown corner, I believe Lattimore will have his best season as a pro his 3rd year. He has everything you want in a corner, athletic, good size, long, quick, twitchy and fast. If he can continue to polish his technique he’s in for a monster 3rd year.

I wasn't heavily invested in the team when they played the Steelers, but Superbowl 43 still feels like the most entertaining Superbowl I've ever watched, from my perspective. I figured they'd be a lock in 2009, but that season ended with a devastating spanking from the Saints.

I searched online what I can watch with this type of account but nothing comes up. Does anyone know anything about this type of account and how I could upgrade and have all the benefits of Game Pass?

150,This “Baker rips Giants fans” post is exactly what’s wrong with this sub and media in general,"Here’s the full quote 

“When I ask Mayfield about the back-and-forth, he says it bothers him when people perpetuate misinformation about the wide receiver. ""He's here to work, and he wants to be surrounded by people who love him and support him and allow him to be himself,"" he says. ""He's here to play in front of fans who actually care, who will actually show up to every game and pack the stadium and love him for who he is.""

Should he have said it? Probably not. There’s probably even a slight diss in there about Giants fans. But to say he “rips” their fans is such a gross exaggeration, it’s disgusting. Baker needs to keep his mouth quiet at times but man people, you perpetuate this problem of misquotes and taking things out of context. Read before making comments.

The running back position itself is valuable, but generally the actual back is not - a lot of the production is a function of a good oline/good scheme, and having role playing running backs (ones who catch passes versus ones who run through the tackles) can replace 70-80% of the production of a star running back. You can also get those role player types for very cheap too - a guy like Duke Johnson is on a 3 mil per year contract, and he'd be very valuable as a complimentary pass catching back.   


It got me thinking though: even if you have a top 10/top 5 running back, is the incentive to pay them ever great enough that it's actually a good decision? In a vacuum, maybe, but if that money can go to offensive/defensive linemen or quarterbacks or even wide receivers, why would you ever invest more money than you have to for the most replaceable position in football?",nfl,IDontRegreddit,41,2019-07-17
168,16 games in an 18 game season - an equally stupid counter proposal,"Lengthening the season by 2 games means the players get beat up more, careers shorten, yada yada yada.

Instead of limiting players to 16 games (which I think would make for incredible telivision, if nothing else), why not make the season the same length?

So, my stupid proposal: 

There are 60 minutes in an NFL game, and a team plays 16 games a season. That's 960 minutes each season. So, let's distribute that time over 18 games instead of 16. That gives us **53 minutes and 20 seconds for each game**, or **13 minutes and 20 seconds every quarter**.

Is this equally stupid? Yes. Should this happen? No. Could it happen in today's crazy NFL?

174,"Who were the ""Cool fat coaches"" in the league or from your youth? and how they keep moral, and loyalty on the team.","So, a former teammate of mine sent me this clip.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/holdmyfries/comments/cedflo/hmf\_as\_i\_race\_this\_robot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdmyfries/comments/cedflo/hmf_as_i_race_this_robot/) \- Coach races Robot.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was hilarious, and we started to talk about our playing days. This also dwelled into who the ""Cool fat coach"" was, and the bets, and things he'd do, to get us motivated, or deals he'd make if we ""Won that playoff game, or Beat this rival"" etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we discussed,  ""Why is it important to have a coach like this on the team(head coach or otherwise)?  Since I believe the trick to being a great coach, involves working the team hard, like dogs or horses, but give them a goal to get to with an incentive. But if they get there, the coach (usually fat) has to pay off on that bet, deal, etc... If he does, he'll have the team in his pocket, and they'll run through 'fire' for him (I've had a few coaches I've felt like that for) if that's what they need to do to win. If the coach does that, 'stupid thing' he keeps his word or honors the bet (no matter how humiliating)he has the team.  They trust him, believe in him since he'd sacrifice something just to help them. It means a lot. If the coach(or coaches) make a promise or a bet, and they lose it and do not honor it... The team will slowly dissolve, and turn on them. Since if he'll not even keep his 'word' to us, then, I can't trust him. That little whole in the team's sweater will unravel the team by the end of the season. I believe in the John Madden philosophy of football. It's all psychology.

&amp;#x200B;

I know plenty of people on this sub have played high school, college, and some even played pro. So, I'd love to hear some ""Cool fat coach"" stories, the stupid bets or things he'd do for moral, and how awesome he was. Also, who are the beloved ""cool fat coaches"" in the NFL, that does, or would do stuff like this? (also, any coaches, or NFL, etc.. that didn't honor their 'word' to the team, and if it unraveled and destroyed the team from within.)

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it's the 'little things' that make all the difference on a football team, I consider things like this(the video), part of it, in building team trust, camaraderie, and loyalty.

&amp;#x200B;

(On the list, of cool 'fat coaches' I put Andy Ried in there, haha. He was a beloved coach on the Eagles, and though I'm not a KFC fan, I can tell he's having a blast coaching Mahones and that squad. I always think of this clip, that let's me know, Andy Ried is down

Let's have a Detroit Lions edition.

*  Detroit was the first team in NFL history to finish 0 -16 which extended next season to a 19 game losing streak (Tied 3rd Longest). To put this in perspective, the Cleveland Browns longest losing streak is 17 games. The two teams with longer losing streaks are the 1940's Arizona Cardinals and the then 76' expansion team, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After winning their first game in over a year, the Lions got blasted by their rival the Chicago Bears 48 -24 the next week.

* Detroit broke their own NFL record for consecutive road loses, losing 26 in a row from Nov 2007 to Dec 2010. 

* Since the renaming of the NFC Central Division to the NFC North in 2002, the Lions have not won a division title. The other 3 teams in the division have each won at least 3 times. If it sounds like cherry picking, the Lions haven't won any division since 1991. 

* The Lions have not won a playoff game since 1991, they have not won a road playoff game since 1957. Additionally, the Lions are one of four and the only NFC team to have never made it to a Super Bowl.

* At one point the Lions had over 47 games without winning consecutive matches. 

* Lions drafted Charles Rogers before Andre Johnson. Johnson went on to have 1062 catches, 14,185 yards and 70 TDs. Rogers 
would have 36 catches, 440 yards and 2 TDs. 

* After taking two Wide Receivers (including Rogers) in the 1st round the previous 2 drafts, the Lions drafted another receiver in the 2005 draft, Mike Williams at 10. Demarcus Ware, Shawne Merriman, Jammal Brown, Thomas Davis and Derrick Johnson were selected picks 11-15, each went on to earn pro-bowl honors. 

* Arguably the two greatest players at their positions, Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson walked away in their primes citing that they could not see the Lions contending anytime soon.

[johnson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/19965878/calvin-johnson-retiring-no-chance-super-bowl-detroit-lions)

* The Lions got cursed by their winningest qb of all-time. There is actually a [website](http://curseofbobbylayne.com/wordpress/) for this. 
How many franchises are cursed by their best player?? 

* The refs once asked the [Lions fans to be quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XLQdUlK0_8) so the other team could snap the ball..it was a home game for the Lions.

* Rather than go into details here is a list of plays the Lions were screwed over on including 3 rules which were implemented in following seasons.

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Atlanta Falcons.**

**3** | **Thomas DeCoud** | **DB** | **2008** | In DeCoud’s six seasons with the Falcons, he started 78 games and recorded 14 interceptions. During the 2012 season, DeCoud had six interceptions, which ranked fifth in the NFL that season, and was named to the Pro Bowl.
**4** | **Ken Reaves** | **DB** | **1966** | Reaves played eight seasons with the Falcons, starting 97 games and recording 29 interceptions. In the 1969 season, Reaves made the Pro Bowl; he finished inside the top nine of the league in interceptions three times, and from 1967-1973, missed just one start.
**5** | **Grady Jarrett** | **DL** | **2015** | Jarrett has spent four seasons with the Falcons so far, starting 46 games, recording 14 sacks, and picking up 31 tackles for a loss. In 2017, his 15 tackles for a loss ranked ninth in the league, and last season, he finished inside the top 10 in fumbles forced; Jarrett was recently signed to a four-year deal worth $68 million.
**6** | **Fulton Kuykendall** | **LB** | **1975** | Kuykendall played 10 seasons with the Falcons, starting 93 games in that stretch. He was named a First Team All Pro by *Pro Football Weekly* in 1978, as well as a Second Team All Pro by UPI that same season, and served as the team’s primary starter at left or middle linebacker in seven out of his 10 seasons with the team.
**7+** | **Greg Brezina** | **LB** | **1968** | Brezina played 11 seasons with the Falcons, starting 140 games and serving as the primary starter at right linebacker for 10 seasons. He made it to the Pro Bowl in 1969 after leading the league with five fumbles recovered, and started every game for the Falcons from 1971-1974 and from 1977-1979.

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** First, I looked at possible quarterbacks for this team, and the only ones that were up for consideration were all first round picks. Again, a guy like Brett Favre doesn’t count; I’m only looking at what they did with that team (otherwise, I’d put Favre in round two, Julio Jones in round one, and let those two run wild). Because of this, Matt Ryan had to take up the first round spot. There were no Hall of Famers to fill in anywhere, so next, it was about finding obvious gaps where the quality of one player in a round was leagues above everyone else. An offensive lineman had to be used in round six, because only two players did anything of note in that round, and both of those guys were offensive linemen (Houston Hoover and Calvin Collins); I went with Hoover in the end. Then, I put Jeff Van Note in the 7+ spot, as he was leaps and bounds above everyone else (except for Jamal Anderson, but seeing as I knew the offensive line was going to need some serious work, I needed to have at least one high quality player on the line).

When it came to rounds 2-4, there were a bunch of combinations to choose from. One combination that I considered was having Alge Crumpler at tight end in round two, Harry Douglas at wide receiver in round three, and then Devonta Freeman at halfback in round four. Another combination included boosting the offensive line some more by putting RC Thielemann in the round two spot, and another combination had tight end Jim Mitchell in the round four spot. There were a lot of possibilities to go with here; however, I went with Emanuel, Andrews &amp; Freeman. It was probably the most balanced combination of the bunch, and a two-halfback set of Andrews and Freeman could be deadly, especially since Freeman/Tevin Coleman was a great set and Andrews is better than Coleman. However, if you want to create a team, I highly encourage you to play around with rounds 2-4, because there were so many possibilities and it was tough to choose one. With all of that, I had to pick an OL/TE hybrid for round five, and went with Brett Miller since he was practically the only player of note on offense in round five at any position.

**Defense:** First, I looked at the spots where my hands were tied, and where there was only one clear cut option at a position. This applied in the third round with Thomas DeCoud in the secondary, and in the fourth round with Ken Reaves in the secondary. In the 7+ spot, the only feasible play was Greg Brezina at linebacker, and in the fifth round spot, the only feasible play was Grady Jarrett on the defensive line.

Three rounds to go (rounds one, two and six), and I need a joker, a linebacker, and a defensive lineman. Once again, there were a bunch of combinations to choose from, and in the first round, I had three different teams created, with one for Deion Sanders, one for Claude Humphrey, and one for Tommy Nobis. In the end, the defensive line probably needed the most help, so I went with Humphrey for the first round spot. Now, I needed a linebacker and a joker; there was no good linebacker that caught my eye in round two, but I liked Fulton Kuykendall in round six (there wasn’t really a standout player in round six, but he was the closest thing to it), so he fit in there. With flexibility to do anything in the round two spot, I went with Scott Case, though a player like Jonathan Babineaux was an option here as well.

**/r/NFL Rates**

How good is this team? That’s where I want you guys to come in so that there’s an interactive element before we do the postseason voting in a month. Based on the roster that you saw, how far do you think this team can go? Will they be a first round exit, or will they make it all the way to the championship?

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18338064)**

Note that for seeding purposes, I’m going to split it up between the AFC and NFC, and will rank the teams 1-16 in each conference based off of their lifetime winning percentage.

Yesterday, I asked how far you thought Washington was going to go. Here were the results:

Round | Percentage
--- | ---
**Round of 32** | **38%**
Sweet 16 | 14%
Elite Eight | 10%
Final Four | 14%
Lose in the Championship | 0%
Win the Championship | 24%

---

**Final Thoughts**

This team is definitely lacking in certain areas. While there are some good qualities about this team, such as Matt Ryan at quarterback and a defensive line led by a Hall of Famer in Claude Humphrey, there aren’t too many standouts otherwise. The offensive line has some duds, there isn’t a star receiving threat on this team, and there isn’t a truly great player at linebacker or in the secondary (though there are some good ones). This team might have trouble standing out from the rest of the field, but could win a game in the tournament with the right draw.

Table taken from /u/PotRoastBoobs coaching changes thread on /r/DenverBroncos


Broncos fans breathed a sigh of relief when Vance Joseph was [fired](https://www.milehighreport.com/2018/12/31/18134721/vance-joseph-fired-broncos) from the head coaching position. After back-to-back losing seasons, the first time in franchise history since the 1971-72 seasons. This achievement was on the back of a season that could not have ended worse for the team. Clawing back to a 6-6 record following three straight wins, to lose the final four games of the season signed Joseph’s pink slip.


The Broncos coaching search began with some very familiar names to many that follow the NFL closely, as well as a few others that may have been relatively unknown before the off-season began. Beginning with former Indianapolis Colts head coach Chuck Pagano the Broncos followed with meetings that included Los Angeles Rams’ offensive assistant Zac Taylor, Pittsburgh Steelers’ offensive line coach Mike Munchak, New England Patriots’ defensive coordinator Brian Flores, and Chicago Bears’ defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. This cast of candidates could not have a more varying degree of experience from young up-and-comer Taylor to veterans Fangio and Munchak. 


Almost every Broncos fan was against the hiring of Pagano or Flores. With the other three candidates however, there was a major divide. Though many favored Fangio due to his experience and track record of superb defense, there were fans, [such as myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/ac7jdo/closer_look_zac_taylor_head_coach_candidate/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) that wanted a young offensive mind in Taylor to hopefully inspire an improved offense that hasn’t been seen in Denver since 2013. There were supporters for Munchak, but he was very much the gray area between the other two. 


Fangio was the final interview in the process and was reported to be the most impressive of the bunch. He [landed the position](https://www.milehighreport.com/2019/1/9/18173725/vic-fangio-head-coach-denver-broncos) as the new head coach of the Broncos ushering in an era of attention to detail and zero tolerance for giving less than 100%. This hiring however was a point of contention within the organization for a short period of time due to the expectation that Gary Kubiak would return either as an offensive coordinator or in another offensive advising capacity. Kubiak wanted to bring in his former running mate in Rick Dennison who was less that liked by the front office due to his poor offensive showings during his previous stint with the team. 


While the [departure of Gary Kubiak](https://www.9news.com/article/news/gary-kubiak-and-broncos-break-up/73-39058de7-7441-4df9-b01b-b17dc0a51369) was unfortunate because of his history with the team and the insights he brought that many believe aided the team in the 2018 draft, it created an opening to transition the team in a direction that many believe in a positive one. The Broncos entertained the thought of bringing in Zac Taylor as an offensive coordinator for only a brief moment, however it was clear Taylor would be courted into a head coaching position elsewhere. This allowed the Broncos to pursue San Francisco 49ers’ offensive assistant Rich Scangarello. At first the Broncos were blocked from interviewing Scangarello, however, after discussions between the teams the Broncos got their meeting and [hired Scangarello](https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/16/broncos-offensive-coordinator-rich-scangarello/) to take the reigns of the offense. 


Scangarello would not be on his own however with the coup of Mike Munchak from the Steelers in a lateral move. Munchak wanted to be with his family so much that he chose to transition to Denver. This along with Fangio bringing Ed Donatell over from Chicago to be his defensive coordinator solidified the top end of the coaching staff.


**Grades**


Vic Fangio, HC: A-


Fangio brings a wealth of experience from the [Dome Patrol](http://www.nfl.com/domepatrol) in New Orleans to the great early 2010’s linebacking units in San Francisco. While he is a bit older than most first time head coaches, many are confident in his abilities. That only concern is the long term impact this will have on the offense should Scangarello be poached in the near future.


Rich Scangarello, OC: B


While not a hot name by any means, nor a highly sought after candidate, Scangarello comes from the Shanahan coaching tree and is expected to bring an improved offensive mindset to the team. His lack of resume is a major red flag because he could be a big boom or bust hire, but you have to try when your offense is as stale as the Broncos has been.


Ed Donatell, DC: B-


This hire is tough to grade in a vacuum due to Donatell’s lack of experience as a DC. Thankfully Fangio is expected to handle most of the defensive responsibilities. 


Mike Munchak, OL: A+ 


The Steelers line has been fantastic as long as Munchak was there. The Broncos line has been poor over the last 10+ years. This hire doesn’t need much explanation other than it is a massive upgrade for a line that needed help.

|Deiontrez Mount|OLB|Free Agent|

|Jimmy Williams|WR|Free Agent|

|Jerrol Garcia-Williams|ILB|Free Agent|

|Brian Parker|TE|Free Agent|

|Andreas Knappe|T|Free Agent|


When free agency began there was only one player that fans were overly concerned with. Matt Paradis. Paradis came on slowly during his Broncos tenure as a 6th round pick from Boise State, however he quickly endeared himself to the fans by being the most consistent piece on the offensive line for four years. Ending 2018 with a fractured fibula Paradis was placed on IR with his future in Denver uncertain. Many fans and even experts expected Paradis to be drawing $11MM AAV in free agency which was reported to be far more than the Broncos were willing the pay. When he signed a three year, $27MM contract [with the Panthers](https://www.panthers.com/news/matt-paradis-signs-three-year-contract-with-panthers) most fans were upset that the Broncos were unwilling to make a similar offer. 


Outside of Paradis some notable names include Bradley Roby who was a very competent CB3 when supported by Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib, however this past season exposed that role as Roby’s likely ceiling. Shaquil Barrett was a consistent rotational pass rusher for the Broncos that performed well in his limited snaps, however was drawing more than the Broncos could pay for someone in that role. Brandon Marshall and Darian Stewart were key pieces of the 2015 defense that drug the corpse of Peyton Manning to a Super Bowl win, however both had devolved to much lesser versions of their former selves. Marshall could hardly stay on the field and Stewart was exposed on a regular basis. Domata Peko was a significant loss on the defensive line but can likely be replaced and the loss of Jared Veldheer was unfortunate however was expected due to an average performance, albeit the best the play Broncos have seen at right tackle in over half a decade. 


Moving on from Keenum was a much needed move even after only one season. While Keenum bought in from day one and had played well in Minnesota, he was everything he showed himself to be before the one miraculous season. Elway took a shot and it failed. Thankfully Elway has learned to move on from his mistakes. By trading away Keenum it signaled growth, and more importantly, told Broncos fans that the team will never settle for less than the best if it is possible to improve.


**Players signed**


|Player|Position|Old Team|Length|Salary|

:--|:--|:--|--:|:--|

|Ja'Wuan James|RT|MIA|4|$51MM|

|Kareem Jackson|CB|HOU|3|$33MM|

|Bryce Callahan|CB|CHI|3|$21MM|

|Jake Brendel|C|MIA|1|$720K|

|DeShawn Williams|DT|IND|1|$570K|

|Jeff Heuerman|TE|DEN|2|$8MM|

|Zach Kerr|DT|DEN|2|$5MM|

|Kevin Hogan|QB|DEN|1|$1.29MM|



This free agency was limited by a small amount of cap space than most team would prefer to go in with. However it is still arguably the best free agency the Broncos have had since 2014. Now, this class is far from star studded and impressive, but it is solid, which is just what the Broncos needed. Ju’Wuan James may not be the best right tackle in the league, but without even playing a down for the team yet it is very possible he is the best right tackle the Broncos have had in a very long time. 


Kareem Jackson and Bryce Callahan should come in and immediately get a considerable number of snaps in Fangio’s versatile defense. The Broncos secondary had a hard fall from grace after [2015](https://i.imgur.com/HKtP5XV.png) that saw the decline and loss of T.J. Ward, Darian Stewart, and Bradley Roby, as well as the trade of Aqib Talib. Jackson and Callahan should at the very least provide a bump in production that the team has been missing in the back end for a couple of years now.


Jeff Heuerman was an uneventful re-signing for the team that highlighted the desperation of the Broncos at the tight end position. With a depth chart that was featuring the kneeless wonder Jake Butt and Troy Fumagalli who both spent most, if not all, of 2018 on IR the signing of Heuerman was a desperation move, even with Heuerman being such a frequent IR candidate that he has completed a punch card for a free MRI.

As a preface to my grading. Yes there may be some bias. However, taking draft position, need, and the caliber of player selected there is justification for each grade. 


Noah Fant: A


The Broncos went into the draft with the 10th overall pick. Most expected Devin Bush to be the pick as many of the blue chip players would be off the board at that point. The team surprised with the move trading down with the Steelers for number 20 and additional capital.


Fant solves a massive problem for the Broncos, and fills a gap that hasn’t been touched since the departure of Julius Thomas after the 2014 season. The tight end position has been a revolving door for years from Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis to Virgil Green and Jeff Heuerman and everyone else that has made a guest appearance. Fant is a freak athlete that bring verticality in the passing game and an excellent red zone target to pair with second year wideout Courtland Sutton. I wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/bjjpmb/oc_what_to_expect_from_noah_fant_in_the_shanahan/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) covering the expectations for Fant based on Flacco’s preference for tight ends and the likelihood of Scangraello’s usage. In short Fant will be a productive receiver for the Broncos and offer an additional threat to the passing game that is desperately needed. The only concern that many have for Fant is his blocking ability. However his blocking is less of a problem as it is more of just an unrefined skill that he should be able to develop in time. Fant should be the immediate starter at tight end and will share some snaps with the other guys on the roster.


Dalton Risner: A


Risner was a fan favorite before the draft due to him being a Colorado kid from the town of Wiggins. His ability on the field warranted a first round pick by many pundits, yet he slipped into the second and was a huge get for the team that needed any and all help on the offensive line. Risner is not extremely gifted in any one area, but he is incredibly solid across the board. He played center and right tackle in college, provided excellent pass protection and is an aggressive run bocker. Overall this pick brings little hesitation from anyone and should immediately help the team. Risner is expected to be the starting left guard week one.


Drew Lock: A+


Shameless self plug for /r/DoTheDrew. Now, I’m likely not the biggest Drew Lock fan in the world, after all, he comes from a great family. However, I have been a fan of his since his bowl game against Texas a year and a half ago. The kid impressed me from day one and, as /u/BlindManBaldwin can attest to, I saw the fit for Lock with the Broncos and especially Elway being fond of him from the beginning. Lock is not perfect by any means. But Lock brings a new breath of life that the Broncos have not had in a young quarterback since Jay Cutler was drafted. Lock has all the athletic tools to build upon including incredible arm strength. He is a determined kid that desires to learn and get better every day which is what separates him from former Broncos heir Paxton Lynch. Lock is expected to be the backup quarterback to Joe Flacco to start the season and should be in that role for the duration of the year. Now, Flacco is no stranger to injuries so it would not be a stretch to expect Lock to get some playing time or even a start this season in lieu of Flacco missing time. Drew is the heir apparent in Denver and will likely be the starting by 2021 if not 2020. For a second round pick this is the perfect kind of guy to be taking.


Dre’Mont Jones: A


No one expected Jones to make it to the third round. His talent alone deserved a higher pick but due to the depth of defensive line in this draft he fell further. Jones is not a true defensive tackle in that you will not want him in on every down, especially against the run. He is however, extremely disruptive in the passing game due to his size and speed. The guy is already incredibly proficient at pushing the pocket and getting into the backfield. This kind of player up front was a major need for the Broncos and a role they have struggled to fill since Malik Jackson left for Jacksonville. Jones is expected to be a rotational piece on the line and produce on third downs to help Bradley Chubb and Von Miller get an easier pass rush off the edge.


Justin Hollins: B-


This pick is very solid for the position, however is middling in most aspects. Hollins played as an edge rushing linebacker that very rarely dropped into coverage during his time in Oregon. He was not a prolific pass rusher, nor an outstanding offball backer. Hollins getting drafted into the league is based almost entirely on potential due to his incredible athleticism and size. The Broncos have stated they will try Hollins as both a coverage linebacker and a pass rusher. From the first rookie camp it has been said that Hollins has performed well in coverage which would be a massive gain for the Broncos and turn this pick into an A grade if he pans out. He is expected to be a rotational piece at whichever spot he lands and a special teams contributor when the season starts.


Juwann Winfree: F


This is the one pick that absolutely baffles me and many other Broncos fans across the board. The Broncos not only took Winfree earlier than they should have, they traded up to do it. There is some speculation that this pick was made as an apology for letting Phillip Lindsay go undrafted last year, who is a former teammate of Winfree’s at Colorado and shares an agent with him as well. Winfree was expected by all to go undrafted, and most scouts failed to even do any film study on him. While he may develop into a decent backup and rotational receiver, he isn’t expected to ever doing anything considerable outside of special teams contributions.

###Other Offseason News that Affected the Team


Fortunately for the Broncos this off-season has been very tame. With no Aqib Talib to shoot himself and Chad Kelly taking care of his [arrest during the season](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/23/broncos-qb-chad-kelly-arrested/) it has been drama free. The biggest Broncos related news has been the trade of Case Keenum to the Redskins and the trade for Joe Flacco from the Ravens. Flacco is expected to be a stopgap for the team until Drew Lock is ready to take over as the full time starter. Though Flacco is far from perfect he’s still a very serviceable player and an improvement over the likes of Keenum, Lynch, and Trevor Siemian. While expectations are not sky high for the new Broncos quarterback, they are high enough that missing the playoffs would be disappointing if Flacco is at fault.


---


###Projected Starting Lineup


* QB: Joe Flacco


Flacco, even in his declined state, is still the best quarterback the Broncos have fielded since 2014 Peyton Manning. If he steps on day one and plays the way he was playing last year for the Ravens he would be a major upgrade over Keenum and give the team exactly what they need.


* RB: Phillip Lindsay, Royce Freeman


With an improved passing game thanks to Flacco and Scangarello, Lindsay should be running even better than he was last year. With Phil and Royce Freeman both expected to be back at 100% and ready to go with a full season under their belts, the Broncos rushing attack will be devastating. Lindsay was rarely used in passing situations last year, that should change and will really start to open things up for the offense as a whole. 


* FB: Andy Janovich


Manovich is an absolute menace out of the backfield and will make a name for himself this year. The Shanahan style offense that Scangarello will be bringing in is notable for using versatile fullbacks like Janovich. He will get more carries, but more importantly he’ll be used in the passing game like he should have been the last few years. Improved usage to go with his monstrous blocking will solidifying a devastating rushing attack.


* TE: Noah Fant, Jeff Heuerman, Jake Butt, and Troy Fumagalli


As I mentioned earlier when talking about Fant, this position has been maligned for years. Fortunately Fant does not have many injury concerns and the other three guys should be able to provide one full season combined. I’m a firm believer in Butt as someone who just needs to be healthy to be a game changer, and Fumagalli provides a rock solid option. The Broncos passing attack will finally have a solid receiving option at tight end and it should scare other teams when coupled with the rushing game that has developed.


* WR: Emmanuel Sanders, Courtland Sutton, DaeSean Hamilton, Tim Patrick


This is an odd position because it’s deep in that almost all the guys on the roster are playable, but the only high level player is Sanders who is coming off an achilles tear at 31 years old that could [slow him down considerably](https://twitter.com/ESanders_10/status/1150896109503598593). Sutton looks like he is poised for a break out year and could be a huge contributor with Flacco’s deep shots. Hamilton and Patrick are both useful but are far from what you look for in a truly reliable receiving threat, should either of them develop then the Broncos will be feilding a solid receiving group between Sutton, Sanders, Fant, and whomever proves themelves.



* LT: Garett Bolles


It’s hard to say Bolles has disappointed thus far, but only because my expectations for him were so low I threatened to change my fandom if we took him in the 2017 draft. This section will get me flamed by certain Broncos fans but the fact of the matter is that Bolles has not developed like the team had hoped in his first two years and this is likely his do or die season. With Munchak coming in there is room for optimism but personally I err on the side of hopelessness. The “kid” is going into only his third season but at 27 years old with his calling card from college being athleticism and tenacity. Fortunately he still has those two things, unfortunately he still has his trademark concern from college which is suspect pass blocking and a tendency to hold. If he can put it together then the Broncos will exercise his fifth year option in a year, should he fall short he could see his time in Denver end as soon as the 2020 season with the upcoming draft class having very solid tackle prospects.


* LG: Dalton Risner


As I mentioned above, Risner was a slam dunk pick for the early second round. He should be an immediate improvement over previous guards on the team in Max Garcia and Billy Turner (Turner started to develop well towards the end of last year). His pass protection is excellent for a rookie and he has a mean streak that’s so intense even Derek Wolfe [has brought it up](https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/2019/06/13/denver-broncos-players-tell-dalton-risner-to-tone-it-down-at-practice/). 


* C: Connor McGovern


Connor is heading into his 4th year on the team after getting considerable playing time last year at right guard until Paradis went down. McGovern was a very solid piece at right guard and in all honesty I would prefer he stay there due to his lackluster performance at center at the end of last season. Hopefully Munchak and an entire off-season will ease him into a role where he can be a long term answer.


* RG: Ronald Leary


Leary is very likeable and above average when playing. The downside is that he has only played one full season in seven years in the league. Last year Leary went down with an achilles tear that put him IR. Right guard is easily the most concerning spot on the line even with McGovern’s lack of experience at center just due to the uncertainty surrounding Leary’s durability. If he can stay healthy the line will benefit from his outstanding run blocking and good pass protection.


* RT: Ju’Wuan James


James is easily the marquee free agent of this year’s class for the Broncos. As I’ve stated many times already, right tackle was a source of misery for Broncos fans and quarterbacks alike for the last half decade or more depending on your opinion of Orlando Franklin and Ryan Harris. James is certainly not the best tackle in the league, but with Munchak and solid talent around him, he’ll be perfect for what the Broncos need him for, an above average right tackle that will hopefully slowdown the likes of Joey Bosa, Frank Clark, and Clelin Ferrell. Even if he is not totally deserving of being the highest paid right tackle in the league, he’ll be praised by Broncos fans so long as he continues to play at his current level.


* DL: Derek Wolfe, Shelby Harris, Adam Gotsis, Dre’Mont Jones


In 2017 the Broncos gained a new moniker “Ground Control” because the run defense was as dominant as you could find anywhere in the league. Unfortunately that name faded rather quickly, and was a distant memory in 2018 when Bilal Powell and Isaiah Crowell put up over 300 rushing yards on the team. Derek Wolfe is still a vicious animal on field, however his talent and play has dropped off over the last few years with injuries piling up. Shelby Harris broke out this past year as a very solid piece on the line that will be deserving of a decent sized contract in the coming off-season. Adam Gotsis also showed his worth in the past year by displaying the ability of a younger Derek Wolfe. Between those three being excellent against the run and the addition of Dre’Mont Jones as an interior pass rusher there is hope yet for ground control to return to form. 


* EDGE: Von Miller, Bradley Chubb, Jeff Holland


There really isn’t must to elaborate on here that most of you don’t already know. It’s Von Miller. He is the best pass rusher in the league. His bend is unmatched and he never stops improving. Combined with Bradley Chubb they form one of, if not the, best passing rushing duos in the league. Chubb is coming hot off a year that typically would have been deserving of defensive rookie of the year if not for Darius Leonard having an all time great rookie year. Chubb looks to get better and with an improved defense around him along with a much better defensive coordinator it’s not a stretch to expect this duo to combine for 30+ sacks in the coming season. Jeff Holland is mentioned as the main rotational piece for the edge spot and will provide a nice break for Miller and Chubb when needed.


* LB: Todd Davis, Josey Jewell, Alexander Johnson, Justin Hollins


This is easily the weakest and most concerning position group on the entire team. Going into the draft my dream involved Devin White, but he was gone well before the Broncos could have picked and Devin Bush would have been a difficult pill to swallow for not only myself but clearly the Broncos front office as well. Davis improved last year in coverage but still has major steps to take in that department, on the plus side he does provide consistent run stopping. Jewell looks like he will be serviceable but is undersized against bigger backs and is too slow to cover faster ones, he lacks much of the traits that most starting linebackers need but he is instinctive and smart enough to make up for some of his physical deficiencies. Johnson entered the league last year at 26 years old after facing league problems that were eventually resolved in his favor, he has the physical tools to become a formidable player but expectations are at zero and anything positive would be a bonus. Hollins in the wildcard that will strictly be a rotational and special teams player barring unexpected talent as an offball linebacker. The saving grace for this position is the track record that Fangio has with developing linebackers and getting them to play well above their talent level.


* CB: Chris Harris Jr., Bryce Callahan, Isaac Yiadom, Kareem Jackson


Chris Harris Jr. is the only recognizable face in this group for many Broncos fans and even most NFL fans in general. CHJ is one of the best corners in the league both in the slot and covering the outside as well despite the lack of attention he gets for his outside play. Callahan is talented and knows Fangio’s defense coming from Chicago but is often injured which adds a good amount of uncertainty to what will be happening in the secondary. Isaac Yiadom will be heading into his second year. While he was not a stand out player by any means, he showed enough to earn a rotational spot and some time on the field. Jackson is listed at the end here because his role is still rather unknown in terms of if he will be a corner or a safety a majority of the time. Because in Fangio’s scheme it does not matter much, he will float where needed and will take some snaps from the other guys listed before him.


* S: Justin Simmons, Kareem Jackson, Will Parks, Su’a Cravens


Outside of Simmons and Jackson (when he gets snaps in this role), things will be very fluid in the “strong safety” spot. Simmons in an athletic freak that showed out as a very capable free safety in his first few years. Last year he was forced into playing strong safety and even corner at times due to injuries to other players. He should be back to his natural role this coming year and will be back to form. Jackson is a much better safety than corner, but the Broncos have not wholly committed to one role for him and it is a bit concerning due to his past shortcomings at corner, but with Fangio coaching there is not much room for fans to be overly worried until after he hits the field. Parks has been a competent safety and even showed some real promise this past season but has yet to show that he is deserving of a full time role and will have to earn playing time. Cravens is in a similar situation to Parks minus the fact the he showed promise. The Broncos picked Cravens up last year in a trade from the Redskins, he had not played for almost two whole years and came onto the field looking rustier than a sunken ship. Cravens must earn his spot on the 53 this year and I firmly believe that if he can show the talent that got him drafted he will not only make the team but also earn a decent number of snaps throughout the season. 


* K: Brandon McManus


McManus has been the stallworth the Broncos have always had at kicker. He had a down year in 2017 but returned to form in 2018. His consistency and reliability when needed has been a source of comfort for most fans. He’s a kicker, there isn’t much else to say other than he isn’t going anywhere.


* P: Colby Wadman


No it’s not Marquette King and that will probably surprise many. After signing King from the Raiders last year King got into it with some local reporters. Between that, his nagging injuries, and poor performance he was placed on IR and subsequently released. Colby Wadman was brought in as the replacement for King and performed admirably. While he won’t be wowing anyone with booming kicks or coffin corner placement, he has done enough to keep his role as the starter for the coming season.


* KR and PR: Open


These two spots are total wildcards. Lindsay had some time at punt returner last year but that is unlikely to continue and Sanders likely no longer has the speed to fill the role either. I could not even begin to speculate which players will get a shot in these roles but River Cracraft (WR) and Brendan Langley (CB converted to WR) will likely be tested here if they can make the roster.


---


###Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses


Position groups:


* QB


Flacco is not the best quarterback in the league, he may not even be very far above average at this point. But he is serviceable which is a far step up from the Broncos quarterbacks of yesteryear. Flacco brings a strong arm and a deep passing attack that can stretch the defense more than most quarterbacks which is all the Broncos really needed when it comes to focusing on developing a team that can focus on running the ball.


* Backfield


The trio of Lindsay, Freeman, and Janovich will create a devastating attack that defenses will not want to face. It may be biased to say but the Broncos could field a top five rushing attack in the coming season with the level of talent and the versatility provided by these players. Freeman is the thunder to Lindsay’s lightening and with Janovich paving the way there aren’t many linebackers that will be looking to get in the mix at the line of scrimmage. 


* OL


With the addition of Ju’Wuan James and Dalton Risner the Broncos may have their most complete line since Elway’s playing days. Every single player on the line is a nasty run blocker which only adds to the rushing attack. What needs to be shown by this cast is the pass protection to buy Flacco time to throw down the field. If all five guys can play to their potential then the Broncos will easily have an above average line and will compete for a spot as a top line in the league.


* Pass catchers


After the departure of Demaryius Thomas last season many would expect this group to take a step back in the coming year. However, Courtland Sutton made it possible to overlook Thomas’ departure in terms of on-field production. With Sanders hopefully returning to a decent level, Sutton getting a full off-season to hone his route running, and the addition of Fant the Broncos should be looking at a very good receiving group and enough speed and size across the board to really intimidate opposing secondaries. 


* DL

 

The defensive line should only be bolstered by this off-season’s changes. While the loss of Domata Peko may sting on the interior, the rest of the line projects to be at its best with coach Bill Kollar always getting the most out of his guys. The edge presence will be every bit as menacing as everyone has come to expect in recent years and with improved interior play from guys like Harris, Gotsis, and Jones there should be ample room for the Broncos to be fielding a top ten unit against the run.


* LB


This group is a hodgepodge of talents that can honestly make or break the entire defense. The most proven of the entire group is Todd Davis who would likely not be an every down starter for most teams and as mentioned before Josey Jewell has his own deficiencies. If Fangio can get this group to play well then the defense will click and perform well, but there is a very large margin for error here that should scare most fans.


* Secondary


The Broncos secondary will have a lot to prove this coming year with multiple new faces that will see a large number of snaps. To say it will be a dominant group like years past would be a stretch, but they should still develop well into the later part of the season. If all the players live up to expectations then the secondary will be no worse than most teams in the league and may even take a step towards its former glory. 

 

* Special Teams


McManus is one of the best kickers in the league. He has one of the best legs in terms of power and being able to drive the ball any necessary distance. While his accuracy took time to develop and he slumped in 2017, he has been as reliable as just about any other kicker aside from Justin Tucker. Wadman has shown to at least be average and playable at worst, though with his age and lack of experience he still has to prove he can do it regularly. 


The major question mark is the return positions which have been a terrible pain for the Broncos for some. Depending on who proves themselves in those spots should hopefully provide a spark that is desperately needed. Others special teams spots should be filled capably by guys like Janovich, Hollins, Keyshawn Bierria, and others that have proven to be solid gunners, blockers, and the like for the special teams units. Overall the Broncos should have an average at worst special teams unit.

**2018 Season**
  
Fletcher Cox's counting stats are as insane as you would expect for the 5th best player of the 2018 season:

| GP | GS | Sacks | Tackles | QB Hits | Hurries | Stops | 
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 16 | 16 | 10.5 | 33 | 24! | 61 | 30 |   
  
Those 24 QB hits lead the NFL in 2018 (tied with Yannick) among all pass rushers. Cox also finished second in the NFL in total pressures with 95 in the regular season. Those 95 regular season pressures by the Monster from Mississippi were eclipsed on 4 separate occasions since 2010 - one of those times by Aaron Donald this year!  
  
Like Aaron Donald, Fletcher Cox wasn't just one of the best Interior Defensive Linemen in the NFL in 2018, he was one of the best defensive players in 2018 and easily the second best pass rusher this year. Cox earned his first 1st Team All Pro Honors after previously earning second team AP 3 other seasons.    
  
[This pass rush clip perfectly exemplifies the season Fletcher Cox had.](https://imgur.com/8ysntYR). Hard to make Zack Martin look like Patrick Omameh but Cox was able to do so. [He's like a big choo-choo train when he attacks a QB](https://twitter.com/TSteegeNFL/status/1130482437228679178) and is [violent](https://imgur.com/eMpApzc) at the point of attack. Violent at the point of attack you say? [He'll throw you out of the club!](https://twitter.com/PFF_AustinGayle/status/1128681961273401344?s=19) Cox is a technician like any top-tier pass rusher in the NFL but what makes him truly great is his elite athleticism, exceptional power, and relentless motor. [All three of those traits are exemplified in this clip from Cox](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1085162371906265089?s=19). Fletch is the recipient of frequent double-teams and slide protections despite the fact that they almost don't matter for him. In that recent clip, Cox easily handled Andrus Peat and Max Unger; this was his first play after leaving the playoff game briefly against the Saints due to a foot injury he'd ultimately have surgery on this offseason. All of the attributes that make him one of the greats in the game were in full display there.   
  
[Even Jared Goff knows to get the hell out of the way when Fletch is coming to eat](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/1074708152917086209?s=19).  
  
[His power and quick burst look almost casual](https://twitter.com/WurthDraft/status/1082033292306796546).  
  
Speaking of Omameh, [poor guy](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1051112757720797184) didn't have [a chance](https://twitter.com/MichaelKistNFL/status/1050904554726989824).  
  
Cox is also a smart and talented [run defender](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1042145918135365633) along the interior of the line. In the last 5 years, Cox is ranked 9th as a run defender among his peers per PFF and was graded very well there again this year. He uses his strength and athleticism well while [always being in a position to make a stop.](https://twitter.com/MichaelKistNFL/status/1050904554726989824) He's an aggressive rusher but he has a relentless motor. Check out these chase downs this season: [1](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1139621738701053952?s=19), [2](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1139627131284140032), [3](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1139971699917635585), [4](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1140671352367702024), and finally [5](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1140705519499436034).   
  
Cox is freaking amazing and the force that makes the entire Eagles defense go. Eagles fans should be ecstatic to add another interior rusher in Malik Jackson that can pair with Cox. While this duo should be a lot of fun on game days, only one man will occupy the nightmares of opposing teams and that's Cox.   
  
**Budding Legacy**  
  
Austin Gayle from PFF wrote an article saying Cox will [go down as one of the best to ever do it](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-while-cast-in-aaron-donalds-shadow-fletcher-cox-will-go-down-as-one-of-the-best-to-ever-do-it) despite living in the large shadow Aaron Donald casts. While I'm unsure about Cox's placement in the history of the NFL, or even what to guess it could end up being, it is hard to argue against that headline. This isn't a slight at Donald by any stretch of the imagination; Donald will most certainly go down as one of the best to ever play in the NFL. It's just crazy to think how Cox has been relatively close to Donald over the years.  
  
Consider the following from the sourced article: *Among the 125 interior defensive linemen with 500 or more pass-rush snaps since 2015, Donald ranks first in pass-rush grade (95.9), total pressures (375) and pass-rush win percentage (22.1%). Cox ranks second behind Donald in all three metrics.* Then Gayle follows it up with this: *And the trend continues, as Donald led all at his position in pass-rush grade in each of the past four seasons (2015-18). Cox ranked second two of the years (2017 &amp; 2018) and third in another (2015).* Lastly, Gayle cites the following: *As previously mentioned, Cox’s pass-rush win rate in 2018 (20.9%) is the fourth-best single-season mark of any defensive interior in the PFF era. And his 91.2 pass-rush grade this past season, another career-high for the big man, also ranks inside the top 10 among qualifiers since 2006.*  
  
Now, this is big-brained PFF material but the proof also matches the tape when you watch Cox over the years culminating into his incredible 2018 campaign. Even Doug Farrar acknowledges Cox is on a [Hall of Fame track](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2019/06/12/the-nfls-11-best-interior-defensive-linemen/10/) at this point in his career. While Cox still has more to achieve in order to be enshrined, he's undoubtly heading that way. It's quite likely fair to say that Cox is already the best defensive tackle in Eagles history. In a lot of other eras throughout NFL history, he'd be the best active player at his position let alone one of the best players in the league. He's rightly overshadowed by the excellence of his contemporaries in Donald and Watt who have already forged Hall of Fame careers... but Cox is great enough to cast a legacy all his own.  
  
And he is doing just that.

Coming into the 2018 season at a whopping 39-years-old, nobody expected Drew Brees to put up the gaudy volume stats we saw from him throughout most of his career. Instead, the king of volume decided to put together the most efficient season of his legendary career.

It's no secret that Brees' arm strength has diminished and he isn't capable of some of the things he once was. He has been forced to adapt. In his 2012 season (5177 yards, 43 touchdowns), Brees' average completion traveled 7.15 yards through the air. In 2018, that figure has dropped to just 5.95 yards per completion.

Given the relatively short average distance of his passes, Brees' [expected completion percentage](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/passing#expectedCompletionPercentage) was 67.0% this season, the 6th highest in the league among active quarterbacks. However, Brees' actual completion percentage wasn't the 6th highest in the league -- by completing 74.4% of his passes, Brees blew away his own single-season completion percentage record. This disproves the argument that Brees' high completion percentage is just a result of him being conservative -- five quarterbacks had a higher expected completion percentage (Carr, Mariota, Brady, Manning) than Brees last year, yet none of them came close to Brees' accuracy. 

Some may argue that Brees' numbers benefited from a very talented offensive unit. While the Saints' receiving corps was very mediocre (if even) outside of Michael Thomas, we can entertain this argument. Brees' accuracy percentage ([from PFF](https://imgur.com/42OwVWL)) also happened to lead the league by a wide margin. His adjusted completion percentage (takes into account drops, spikes, etc) of 82.2% still holds a significant edge over second-place (Kirk Cousins, 79.5%). Whichever way you want to look at it, Drew Brees is the most accurate quarterback in football.

Brees' performance over the course of the season led to incredible results for the New Orleans Saints. The Saints averaged 3.21 points per drive, the second-most (2018 KC, 3.25) since the 2007 Patriots. That's pretty good company. The Saints won 13 of 15 games with Brees under center. Despite the dominant regular season, though, Brees wasn't exactly coasting by. He still led the league in both fourth-quarter comebacks (6) *and* game-winning drives (7). 

In addition to his absurd completion percentage, Brees boasted the third-highest touchdown percentage in the league among starting quarterbacks, the highest passer rating, and the second-highest adjusted net yards per pass attempt. In the latest stage of his prolific career, Brees showed that his skill set isn't limited to that of a volume passer -- he's still the most accurate quarterback in league history. 

It's hard to predict how Brees will be remembered. It will certainly hurt that he happened to play in an era with other legendary passers like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and Aaron Rodgers. Maybe having the best playoff stats among the group will bolster his claim to greatness. Or maybe it will be overshadowed by a stretch of 7-win seasons from 2014 to 2016. Regardless of how Brees is remembered, though, he will retire as the all-time leader in passing yards and completion percentage, and possibly even touchdowns. More importantly, he will retire as a champion.

DeAndre Hopkins is the most valuable receiver in the NFL. Julio Jones is bigger, Antonio Brown is quicker, and Odell Beckham is faster, but when it comes to all of the little things that make great receivers great – physicality, ball skills, instincts, and stepping up in huge moments – there is nobody else in the league who can match Nuk as a total package. 

Whether he is dunking on Jalen Ramsey over and over again, or effortlessly catching back shoulder touchdowns against a well-positioned corner, Hopkins is one of the few receivers I’ve ever seen who, even when he’s covered, he’s definitely *not* covered. Nuk’s contested catch rate of 58.1% was extremely high – fifth in the league in 2018 to be exact – and he also set a new record for most receptions in a season without dropping a single pass (115). Simply put, it didn’t matter how good the cornerback was, or how much he was double teamed, if that ball was anywhere near Hopkins’ zip code, he was coming down with it. 

But what was *most* impressive from DeAndre last season, especially for me as a Texans fan, was how he stepped his game up even more when it mattered the most. It’s no secret that the Texans as a team were rather, well…let’s say “fortunate” to win as many games as they did in 2018. There were a lot of bounces that went their way, and a lot of last-minute field goals from our lord and savior John Christian Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a Fairbairn to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. BUT…without DeAndre Hopkins, the Texans would not have had even the slightest whisper of a chance to win all of those “fortunate” games in the first place.

Hopkins had the second most yards in the fourth quarter or overtime of any receiver – trailing only Julio Jones – despite the fact that Houston was 27th in the NFL in total pass attempts, while Atlanta was fifth. He also had the second-most receptions (31), sixth-most yards (359), and fourth-most first down conversions (23) on third or fourth down pass attempts, again despite the fact that all of the names *above* him on those lists came from teams (Kansas City, Minnesota, Green Bay, Cincinnati, Tampa Bay) that passed *significantly* more than Houston did. In short, in big moments that required even bigger plays, Hopkins always delivered.

This man just dragged a team to the playoffs despite the fact that his young quarterback was running for his life all year, his other two top receivers got hurt, *and* he was double teamed on the majority of his snaps. He won with strength, he won with mind games, and he won with a historically good pair of hands. He may not be the most gifted physical specimen in the league, but you bet your ass that you want him on your team more than anyone else on 3rd and 15 in the fourth quarter when you need him the most. The value that Hopkins brings to the Texans is immeasurable, and if that doesn’t mean he is the league’s best wide receiver going into 2019, then I don’t know what does.

Following the regular season finale of 2017, we saw the tremendous potential Patrick Mahomes had. The ceiling was, quite obviously, very high. We also saw the bumpy road that could potentially await. He takes risks and he makes incredible throws, and coming into his first year starting, many of us expected him to have a learning year. Well, if 2018 was a learning year, look out. It became apparent in the first month of the NFL season that Mahomes was special, and not just a little bit.

Backing up slightly here in Chiefs history, I would say that for my entire lifetime as a Chiefs fan, when the opposing team scored to go up by 3 with 39 seconds left and we have one timeout left, the game was over. You just knew it deep down. This is exactly what happened in the AFC Championship Game. Situation: 1st and 10. Down 3. 32 seconds left. Ball at the 31 yard line. 1 timeout available. What does Mahomes do? [First, he’s going to step up, avoid the rush, then roll out to his right and deliver a strike to his running back down the sideline](https://imgur.com/a/deDyziv). From that back angle, you can see how it appears Ware isn’t even open. [Then he’s going to step right into the rush and deliver a deep strike down the middle of the field](https://imgur.com/a/oTsfMC7). And in the blink of an eye, field goal range. Just. Like. That.

I don’t need to post basic statistics here. You all know about the 5,000 and 50 as a first year starter. You know the first team All Pro selection and of course the MVP Award. You probably know he led the Chiefs to 3.25 points per drive this past season, tops in the league. You probably know that he also led the Chiefs to 41.53 yards per drive, which was also tops in the league. Then of course you probably know how atrocious the opposite side of the ball was overall. 26th in DVOA, 31st in yards, 24th in points, and 28th in points per drive, and 32nd in yards per drive is what was going on when Mahomes was on the sidelines watching his defense. The four losses in the regular season, the Chiefs put up an average of 37.5 points. Eclipsed 50 once and 40 once, with the lowest total being 28. This was an offense that was historic, and he spear headed it.

Now I know what you’re thinking. Kelce, Hill, Hunt, Watkins, they’re getting open a lot of times and making throws easy for him. Yes he makes the right read and gets the open guy the ball. Shame on him right? Oh but what about when receivers are covered well? [How bout the best in the league and the best PFF has ever recorded?](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-most-accurate-nfl-qbs-by-separation-in-2018). Need proof? Buckle up. [This is absolutely perfect defense, but it didn’t matter because Mahomes just puts it right over the defender for the TD](https://imgur.com/a/3kr7Q9M). [For good measure, let’s look at that in slow motion](https://imgur.com/a/BZHRKbA). Nothing more could be done. [On this one](https://imgur.com/a/Geoqybl), I’m not even sure how he even made the decision to throw that ball. Defense isn’t sure either. If it wasn’t perfect, that’s picked, or at the very least, incomplete. Turns out it was perfect though. Shocking. Then we have the Raiders. Poor Raiders. On back to back plays, Mahomes is going to make them wonder what more they can even do. [As he rolls out to the right, he places the ball in an absolutely perfect spot for Kelce to go up and get it](https://imgur.com/a/fd3LqK4). As the defense is still recovering from that one, [he fits a ball into a window that essentially wasn’t even there](https://imgur.com/a/zESWgNF). Not defendable at all.

He can stay in the pocket and make throws under duress. He’s not phased. That was evident there in the second paragraph with the AFCCG plays. In case you hadn’t yet heard, he can use his legs and make incredible throws on the run too. Passing while running to his right? [Yep, got that one covered](https://imgur.com/a/XkdF9Os). That ball had to be perfect and thread the needle there after escaping the rush, and it, of course, was. Passing while running to his left? [Uh huh. No problem](https://imgur.com/a/EyIPuD8). You can tell Wagner here didn’t even think for a split second that the ball was going to be thrown behind him. He should have though [if he read the scouting report properly](https://imgur.com/a/fpJ3kHr). Yes he has the [scrambling ability](https://imgur.com/a/dboCSo8) and the ability to throw on the run. The thing that just might be the most impressive though is that he never looks to run unless he has to. Chiefs fans can tell you how many times he stepped up or rolled out and we thought there was running room there, but instead he kept scanning the field. That’s an ability that’s extremely rare for a QB his age that can scramble well. It’s one that will keep him in the league much longer than most.

Patrick Mahomes is the real deal. He showed elite QB play all throughout the 2018 season. He was incredible with the basic stats, the advanced stats, and on film. He shredded defenses in the pocket, he shredded them outside the pocket, and he shredded them with his legs when necessary. He gave us highlight reel throw after highlight reel throw, from [left handed passes](https://imgur.com/a/7YoZ9Ia) to avoid the possible strip sack, or [no look passes](https://imgur.com/a/Uvs2qel) because … well, just because. He literally made every fan’s jaw drop on numerous occasions this season. He made other top tier world class athletes look silly. I would imagine other AFC West teams and even the AFC in general are not looking forward to the next decade plus with this guy under center (or in shotgun, whatever). For his spectacular and historic play in the 2018 season as a walking highlight reel, Mahomes comes in on our list at number (2, 1).

(I'd like to shout out the great Twitter accounts I used to give you all visuals of Donald's play. @BrandonThornNFL, @MarkSchofield, @camdasilva, @SamuelRGold, @QBsMVP, @thecheckdown, @WillBrinson, @SteelersDepot. Thank you all for your great content, give them a follow everyone!)

Man, what can I say about Aaron Donald that hasn't already been said before? He's the GOAT. Plain and simple.

Coming off a season where he ranked #1 on last year's version of this list, many were wondering how could he get better than this? He won DPOY. 1st team All-Pro. Pro Bowl. Nobody would blame you if you thought he had reached his peak. Of course, you'd be wrong.

Donald started training with knives (haters will say they're fake, but still badass anyway) and [perfecting his body](https://twitter.com/RealWorldSports/status/1090040337245061121), looking more like a bodybuilder than a 285 pound defensive tackle. He waited for his massive contract to come, and come it did. 6 years, $135M. Only one year later, he's looking underpaid. Aaron Donald conquered the NFL with maybe the greatest defensive season of all time. He set records, accumulating 20.5 sacks at the defensive tackle position, most of any DT all time. Donald led his team to the Super Bowl, [recording 33 pressures in the 4th quarter and OT](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/1087836309815738370) showing that when the game is on the line, he steps up and performs. Donald won DPOY for the second year in a row, went to the Pro Bowl and was voted All Pro again. Oh, and he did this all while being [double teamed 70% of the time](https://twitter.com/JB_Long/status/1057731895918641153). Absolutely outrageous.

In case you didn't know, Aaron Donald is a really really good pass rusher. You don't rack up [106 pressures](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/1120179423582543872), most in the NFL and second most in the PFF era by accident. Donald puts up edge rusher type numbers as a defensive tackle, an incredibly impressive feat considering the extra traffic up the middle he faces. 

Every great pass rusher has something they excel at. It could be the outside rip and dip move. It could be the swim move. It could be the bull rush. They all have something they specialize in. Aaron Donald has mastered all of them. His [outside club rip](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1070038537930596353) move is devastating, with OL struggling to [keep up with his ability to corner and reach the quarterback](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089940467641450496). Most edge rushers wouldn't dream of making [plays like this](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089947015570694146). The quickness and the bend required is absurd. [Hotness](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089950638253969414). Of course, he can't just throw outside moves all day, they'll expect it every time. That's when Donald flashes his power with the [bull rush](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089962283680350208). Using his meaty paws, he lands his fists right onto the chest of the linemen and [controls them](https://twitter.com/SamuelRGold/status/1061743166519422976), getting push and [moving them backward on his way to the QB](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089946248101142529). And just when OL think they have all that handled, AD throws out the [swim move](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089941646437949442), also called an [arm over](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089954305447202816). This leaves linemen [grasping at air](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089940466353819648) wondering which way Donald has gone. All the way to the QB my friend. This is quite possibly Donald's most dangerous move, because he can attach it to so many different things, like the [aforementioned bull rush](https://twitter.com/MarkSchofield/status/1089951792690069506). He just makes it look [easy](https://twitter.com/camdasilva/status/1079496316047237120), man. This is just a small taste of what AD can do. He has a number of other moves, and when you can get to the QB in so many different ways, he's impossible to stop. Easy to see why he had 20.5 sacks last year.

What many people don't realize, though, is that Donald is an exceptional run defender as well. He's known as a pass rusher, but he destroys gameplans in the run game as well.  Donald had the most  [TFLs](https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1131230151163957248) by a DT in the past 20 seasons, consistently creating big plays for the defense and creating big problems for the offense. 

Many of Donald's best plays in the run game come through one specific trait he has: his [explosion and quickness](https://twitter.com/QBsMVP/status/1072694660160733184). When an offense tries to run a zone blocking scheme or reach block him with an offensive tackle, it doesn't go so well. Donald uses that quickness to shoot the gap, [flying into the backfield and creating havoc for the offense.](https://twitter.com/thecheckdown/status/1076964947320434688). He'll use [his swim move to dominate OL off the ball](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1070018677313949696). Countless times it has [ended up as a TFL](https://twitter.com/camdasilva/status/1069684495027200002) for the offense, like [this play where he dropped Kamara](https://twitter.com/Eric_Edholm/status/1059201943036403719) like he was a mere traffic cone. What offenses have done to try and stop this is using something called a [trap block](https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2012/7/3/3130817/offensive-line-blocking-traps-and-quick-pulling), which intentionally leaves him unblocked so a pulling linemen can hit him from the other side unexpectedly as he pursues the play. This has been very effective on some great DTs such as Ndamukong Suh. The only problem is, Donald is Donald and he knows when they're coming. The Saints [tried it once](https://twitter.com/WillBrinson/status/1087116854907363328) and learned their lesson from then on.

But Donald doesn't just make plays shooting gaps. He's a remarkably sound run defender with exceptional gap integrity. AD will use his [big ol' mits to lock onto the offensive lineman, control his chest and read the play](https://twitter.com/Steelersdepot/status/1107442889485742085). Teams have a difficult time running on him because he can control these gaps like a bigger nose tackle while having the quickness to disengage at a moment's notice or shoot the gap if needed. It makes him an absolute nightmare to game plan for. In every phase you need to know where 99 is. 

In conclusion, Donald is essentially just a monster. You can't block him in the run game, you can't block him in the pass game, you just can't block him at all. He's a future Hall of Famer already and on pace to be the greatest DT ever, and on pace to be up there with with men like Lawrence Taylor and Reggie White as the best defender ever.

326,My Take on Kirk Cousins,"Hey gents I’m a Vikings fan but I am keeping all bias out of this. Simply facts. I have read over the past year that Cousins is a bust and worst contract ever blah blah blah... here is the simple facts. Cousins played his best year of his career while getting sacked 40 times. Second most in his career; the most was 41. 30 TD- 10 INT. Not great but well above average and play off caliber. 4,300 Yards on 70% completion percentage. 99.7 QBR, Top 15 QB in the league. Now that isn’t worth 27.5 million a year I can agree. BUT what he has done in 1 year, with his offensive coordinator being fired mid season, and the defense being a shell of itself the year before he did great. My opinion; give him that Minnesota Defense back, doesn’t even have to be number 1 like they were in 2017. Top 10 is good enough. He has the best WR duo in the NFL. An above average TE. He will put up 4500 yards and 35+ TD. Now with all that said, we still got an elephant in the room; the offensive line. I have no answer for this. The Vikings just don’t draft well in this area. Plain and simple. Garrett Bradbury looks promising as he was the best center in the draft. But we need more and we don’t have it. As of now we can only wonder what will corn of this. But I know if you surround Cousins with good staff and a good all around team. He will be a top 10 Quarterback.",nfl,usmcbare,42,2019-07-18

334,Broncos Offseason Review. Non-Fan Edition,"**Broncos Offseason Review**

**Division: AFC West (6-10, 3rd)**

If you enjoy my offseason review, you can find my other articles for MileHighSports on the Broncos here: https://milehighsports.com/author/zsegars/

Also, I'm genuinely excited to hear your feedback. I have to board a plane soon after posting this but once I land I'll attempt to respond to everyone and make any necessary edits.

**Coaching Changes:**

The Broncos kicked their offseason off by making a much-needed change at the head coaching position, ousting Vance Joseph and replacing him with Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Joseph was both one of the worst head coaches in the league during his time with the Broncos, and one of the worst Denver head coaches in franchise history. Under Joseph, the Broncos posted losing records for the first time under Pat Bowlen’s ownership (Since 1983).

Fangio should usher in a new era of toughness and physicality, while also returning the team to dominant defense supported by the zone-blocking offense that led the team to a Super Bowl victory in 2015.

This will be Fangio’s first head coaching gig, but over the course of his time in the league, he’s become one of the most respected defensive minds and arguably the greatest linebacker coach in NFL history.

Fangio got his first NFL job with the New Orleans Saints in 1986 where he was hired to be their linebackers coach. Under Fangio’s tutelage, the Saints saw the rise of “The Dome Patrol”. A group of four linebackers (Rickey Jackson, Sam Mills, Pat Swilling, and Vaughn Johnson) who were named first-team All-Pros a combined 10 times and went to a combined 18 Pro Bowls with the Saints. All 10 All-Pro nods and all but three of Pro Bowl appearances came with Fangio as the linebacking coach.

Fangio then bounced throughout the league, where he coached the likes of Ray Lewis and Terrell Suggs, Aldon Smith, Navarro Bowman, and Patrick Willis, and most recently Khalil Mack. 

Wherever Fangio goes, excellent linebacking play is soon to follow. The Broncos should be excited considered their dynamic duo of freakishly talented edge rushers, Bradley Chubb and Von Miller.

At offensive coordinator, out is Bill Musgrave and in is Rich Scangarello. Under Musgrave, the offense struggled mightily, finishing 27th and 24th in the league in scoring, and 19th and 17th in total yards during his year and a half at the helm.

The Broncos planned on hiring former head coach and offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak to replace Musgrave and institute the zone blocking scheme that he and Mike Shanahan had popularized in Denver throughout the ‘90s and into the early ’00s. Unfortunately for the Broncos, Kubiak decided to head the Vikings instead over a “philosophical disagreement.”

However, the Broncos will still be able to throw it back to the days of yore with a hint of the Sean McVay/Kyle Shanahan present with Rich Scangarello.

While it’s still yet to be seen if Scangarello will be even near the level of the aforementioned offensive minds is yet to be seen. However, during his time in San Francisco, the 49ers did post one of the more dynamic offenses despite there being a revolving door at quarterback due to injury and uncertainty at the position. Heck, the guy made Nick Mullens look alright.

While Fangio is expected to have a heavy role in the defense, the Broncos officially hired Ed Donatell to be the defensive coordinator. Donatell may prove to be one of the best under-the-radar hirings of the offseason thanks to his expertise with defensive backs and the Broncos’ questionable depth at cornerback.

During his time with the Bears, under Fangio, Donatell’s secondary earned the highest coverage grade that Pro Football Focus has ever given a team over the course of an entire season (95.9).

**Verdict:** The Broncos’ two most glaring holes in 2018 were the coaching staff and the quarterback. With the hiring of Vic Fangio, the Broncos believe they have filled one of those holes. **The firing of Vance Joseph gets an A+** as he was clearly out of his depth as a head coach. **The hiring of Vic Fangio gets a B+** as he was one of the best candidates available and a genius defensive mind, but the common belief now is that teams should hire offensive minds to be their head coach and there have been questions if Fangio is just a great DC that shouldn’t be a head coach like Wade Phillips.


**Free Agency**

**Players Lost**

Player | Position | New Team
---|---|----
Case Keenum | QB | Washington
Brandon Marshall | LB | Oakland
Matt Paradis | C | Carolina
Bradley Roby| CB | Houston
Shaquill Barrett | EDGE | Tampa Bay
Shane Ray | EDGE | Free Agent

The major players the Broncos lost this offseason were quarterback Case Keenum, linebacker Brandon Marshall, center Matt Paradis, cornerback Bradley Roby, and edge rushers Shaquil Barrett and Shane Ray.

* **Case Keenum** was an apparent upgrade on other Broncos’ quarterbacks in the post-Manning era, but it was clear he wasn’t the guy long term. Then again, neither is Joe Flacco but he should be an upgrade—although a slight one—on Keenum. Plus, the Broncos were able to trade him rather than releasing him which saved their salary cap. **Grade A-**

* **Brandon Marshall** was an above-average linebacker for the Mile-High City during his tenure and was one of the last remaining pieces from the Super Bowl 50 win. Marshall will be missed most in the locker room where he was a leader among the defense. Considering his age, injury history, and the young crop of linebackers Denver had behind him though, resigning him wasn’t necessary. **Grade B**

* **Matt Paradis** had been the best lineman along the Broncos’ offensive line since he was inserted into the role midway through their most recent 2015 championship season. Unfortunately, in a 2018 game against the Texans, Paradis fractured his fibula. That injury made the Broncos’ uncertain about his future with the team and left a massive hole on the interior of the offensive line. It’s possible Risner will replace him at center, but if not, the domino effect will be felt throughout Denver’s line, which will be more crucial than ever this season protecting an old, immobile, injury-prone quarterback in Joe Flacco. **Grade D**

* **Bradley Roby** was pegged to be the Broncos’ replacement for Aqib Talib in 2018 but floundered. His consistent poor showing led to the Broncos believing he could only be a number three cornerback at best, so they decided to part ways. That being said, it would’ve made sense to keep the young cornerback as now all of Denver’s top three cornerbacks prefer to play in the slot rather than outside on an island. **Grade B-**

* **Shaquil Barrett** had been one of the Broncos’ unsung heroes dating all the way back to their Super Bowl season. Barrett was a luxury item for Denver that acted like an elite sixth man on an NBA team, allowing them to maintain their stout pass rush while also giving Von Miller, and now Bradley Chubb some snaps off to keep them fresh. The Broncos would’ve loved to hold onto Barrett, especially when considering the cheap price tag, he signed with Tampa ($5 million dollars over one season). **Grade C**

* **Shane Ray** was drafted to be the bookend edge-rusher to Von Miller in the way Bradley Chubb was in 2018. Questions in regard to work ethic and injuries still leave Ray as a free agent which makes it seem that the Broncos made the right choice by letting him go. Losing two of the Broncos’ rotational edge rushers will hurt but overall letting Ray walk is a good move. **Grade A-**

**Players added/signed/re-signed**



Player | Position | Old Team | Length | Salary
---|---|----|----|----
Joe Flacco | QB | Baltimore | 1+2 (team option) | $18.5 M (+$44 M)
Kareem Jackson | CB | Houston | 3 | $33 M
Ja'Wuan James | OT | Miami | 2+2 (team option) | $27 M (+$24 M)
Bryce Callahan | CB | Chicago | 3 | $21 M
Jeff Heuerman | TE | Denver | 2 | $8 M


* **Joe Flacco** was connected to the Broncos ever since the moment Lamar Jackson took his starting job. It appeared the Broncos would sign Flacco in free agency, a move I was vehemently against as it would do immense damage to their cap but working a trade out for the aging veteran is a great move. 

 Instead of paying Flacco $25 million dollars annually for two to three years, the Broncos will be paying him roughly $20 million dollars annually for three seasons with a team option following 2019. Plus, he’s a clear (though slight) upgrade on Case Keenum. **Grade B+**

* **Kareem Jackson** should immediately help the Broncos secondary, though signing a defensive back to a deal that will pay him an average of $11 million until he turns 33 should raise some eyebrows. Remember, the Broncos are only a year removed from trading Aqib Talib to avoid his average annual cost of $9.5 million through his age 33 season. 

 However, Jackson appears to have plenty of gas left in the tank despite being on the wrong side of 30, as he’s coming off a season that saw him earn the fifth-highest grade among cornerbacks from Pro Football Focus. Jackson also earned the highest run-defense grade and allowed the ninth-lowest passer rating when targeted (75.2) among corners to play at least 400 snaps. **Grade B-**

* **Ja’wuan James** became the highest-paid right tackle in football with a four-year $52 million deal. Of Elway’s signings this year, the James deal is certainly the most controversial and with good reason. He was never an elite tackle for the Dolphins, yet now he is making elite money. Ja’wuan James earned the 28th highest grade from Pro Football Focus among all tackles, 12th among right tackles to play at least 700 snaps. 

 However, what he lacks in flashiness, is made up for with consistency. 

 Through his five seasons in the league, James has never earned a season grade below 60 from PFF, a level of play Denver hasn’t been able to find, though they’ve tried with Donald Stephenson, Menelik Watson, and Jared Veldheer. While James is overpaid, his addition will solve one of the Broncos’ longest-nagging issues. 
**Grade C+**

* **Bryce Callahan** agreeing to a deal with the Broncos was the best move a fantastic offseason for GM John Elway. General Manager John Elway saved his best for last with the signing of former Chicago cornerback Bryce Callahan. Callahan is coming off a foot injury that sidelined him for the end of last season but $21 million over three years is an absolute steal for the Broncos.

 Bryce Callahan was a top-ten cornerback in the league last season according to Pro Football Focus and has consistently gotten better with each year in the league. Also, his potential bust rate is much lower than that of most free-agent signings, as he spent the first four years of his career in head coach Vic Fangio‘s scheme. The signing was so good it even made NFL.com’s list of the best free-agent signings. 
**Grade A+**

* **Re-signing Jeff Heuerman** to a two-year deal was a questionable move at best especially when considering the Broncos’ first-round selection of Noah Fant. These two moves combined means that Jake Butt is likely off the roster which is a shame as in limited playing time he actually out-performed Heuerman a season ago. 

 That being said, Heuerman is a young, capable starter coming off the best season of his career and the contract isn’t too expensive. 
**Grade D+**


**Draft**


Round | Pick | Player | Position | School
---|---|----|----|----
1 | 20 | Noah Fant | TE | Iowa
2 | 41 | Dalton Risner | OT | Kansas State
2 | 42 | Drew Lock | QB | Mizzou
3 | 71 | Dre'Mont Jones | DT/DE | Ohio State
5 | 156 | Justin Hollins | EDGE | Oregon
6 | 187 | JuWann Winfree | WR | Colorado


* **Round 1: Noah Fant, TE, Iowa**- The Broncos traded back with the Steelers who selected Devin Bush tenth overall so they could select the hyper-athletic tight end out of Iowa, Noah Fant. The tight end position is one that has plagued the Broncos ever since Julius Thomas departed for Jacksonville. Fant has the potential to not just be the answer for the Broncos but to be one of the best tight ends in the league thanks to his athleticism. 

 At the combine, he out-performed every other tight end at almost every single drill and out-performed most receivers. He’s now being inserted into an offense that made George Kittle break the record for tight end receiving yards just a season ago. Fant won’t produce much in year one as tight ends rarely do as rookies, but once he learns the offense, he could become one of the league’s most dangerous matchups. Trading back from drafting a fiery linebacker like Bush does hurt though. 
**Grade: B**

* **Round 2: Dalton Risner, OL, KSU/Drew Lock, QB, Mizzou**- In the second round, the Broncos selected versatile offensive lineman Dalton Risner, and potential quarterback of the future Drew Lock. 

 Now, I hated the idea of taking Drew Lock in the first round, and especially the top ten, but finding him in the second round is a steal. He has high-end physical traits that maybe aren’t quite on Mahomes’ or Allen’s level as he’s closer to a Matthew Stafford or Jay Cutler. He also has much better character than Paxton Lynch and started in the SEC West for four seasons. 

 Dalton Risner was also expected to go in the first round, making him another steal for the Broncos. Risner is originally from Colorado and wanted to come back home. The Broncos wanted him back home as well as they desperately need help on the interior of their offensive line where Risner is expected to start from day one. 

 Both these picks deserve an A as Risner will be a day one impact starter and Lock could be a franchise quarterback down the line. 
**Grade: A**

* **Round 3: Dre’Mont Jones, DT, Ohio State**- I’m convinced no team in the league had a better day two of the draft than the Broncos. After stealing a foundational offensive line piece and a potential franchise quarterback in the second, the Broncos stole a pass-rushing defensive lineman in the third. 

 Jones was part of the feared Buckeye defensive line that also featured Nick Bosa and 2020 presumptive #1 overall selection Chase Young. While Bosa and Young attacked the edges, Jones came through the middle and was among the best interior pass rushers in all of college football tallying 8.5 sacks last season. 

 That being said, one of the bigger concerns is that outside of last season, Jones doesn’t have much production on his resume. Jones will have a smaller role as a rookie and will be expected to play on the interior of the defensive line on passing downs. If Jones develops, a duo of him and Shelby Harris up the middle while Miller and Chubb attack the tackles is an image that should give AFC West quarterbacks nightmares. 
**Grade: B+**

* **Round 5: Justin Hollins, OLB, Oregon**- After getting an impressive haul on the first two days of the draft, the Broncos opted to swing for the fences with their day three picks. 

 Hollins is an incredibly raw pass rusher that will need a lot of time to develop but he has great upside as a do-everything linebacker. He has the size, speed, and instincts to be above average in coverage and his ability to bend could make him a great rotational edge rusher down the line. 

 The biggest concern here is just how raw he is and his ability to defend the run. Hollins could see some playing time in year one though as the Broncos lost rotational pass rushers Shane Ray and Shaq Barrett this offseason and only have 2018 UDFA Jeff Holland to help alleviate those losses. **Grade: B-**

* **Round 6: Juwann Winfree, WR, Colorado**- The Broncos really swung for the fences traded up to snag Winfree in the sixth round. Most draft sites didn’t even have Winfree listed as a prospect, but the Broncos must’ve liked what they saw at his Pro Day. 

 Winfree has the potential to be a solid receiver in the league and could’ve been a great receiver in college but struggled greatly with consistency and injury. Having the pleasure to interview and meet Winfree, I have to say I get what the Broncos saw in him. His character and football IQ are fantastic for a wide receiver and there were times at spring practices last year when he outplayed 2020 first rounder Laviska Shenault. In fact, heading into the 2018 season he was atop the receiving depth chart for the Buffs. 

 Winfree could either be starting or out of the league in two years and the gamble is questionable considering the Broncos’ wealth of young talent at receiver. **Grade: C+**

**Other News:**

* **Chris Harris Jr. Contract Negotiations:** 

This offseason has been a relatively quiet one for the Mile-High franchise as the biggest news surrounding the team is likely the tense contract negotiations with Chris Harris Jr. 

At a point, it looked like Harris Jr. was almost certainly going to be traded elsewhere on draft night, but the Broncos were unable to find a partner. Harris Jr. has been relatively underpaid throughout his career and now, to be compensated for this discount, Harris Jr. wants to become one of, if not, the highest-paid cornerback in the league. 

The problem is, Harris Jr. is entering his age 32 season and is coming off a season-ending injury to his fibula. Harris Jr. was prepared to hold out if the Broncos didn’t give him a raise, but the sides eventually came to an agreement on a one-year pay bump. That being said, now following this season Harris Jr. is likely to hit free agency as tensions with the front office still seem relatively high.

* **Gary Kubiak spurns Broncos for Vikings:** 

The Broncos hired Kubiak to be their head coach before the 2015 season, paired him with one of the best defensive minds in football and the result was a Super Bowl victory. Unfortunately, Kubiak had to step away from the team with health concerns just a year later which sent the Broncos looking for a coach. 

The plan heading into 2019 was to throw things back to 2015, this time though with a defensive coach as the front man so Kubiak could just be focused on the offense. Unfortunately, a difference of opinions between Kubiak and Elway led to him deciding to take an offensive advisor role with the Vikings where he’s more or less expected to run the offense.

**Projected Starting Lineup**

* **QB: Joe Flacco**- Drew Lock could challenge for this job by season’s end but Elway and Co. have made it clear that Flacco will be the day one starter. Flacco’s been pedestrian at best since his Super Bowl MVP 2012 season. Though, the Broncos believe that’s because he never had weapons. Well, he has them now leaving him without an excuse if things start off rocky.

* **RB: Royce Freeman**- ‘But what about Phillip Lindsay?’ you say. Lindsay was the best surprise in last year’s draft, earning a Pro Bowl nod as an Undrafted Free Agent, but it’s widely believed that the Broncos will lean more on Freeman in 2019. 

 Many think Lindsay’s season-ending wrist injury showed what the cost is of leaning on a 5-foot-8 running back in the NFL, and while Lindsay may still get the majority of overall touches thanks to his work in the passing game, Freeman should be the workhorse back and get the majority of carries in 2019. I’m not saying it’s what I would do, but it is what the Broncos will do.

* **FB: Andy Janovich**- The fan-favorite fullback should see a bump in usage this year as the Broncos adopt the Kyle Shanahan offense. No one used the fullback more last season than the 49ers who used Kyle Juszczyk for 285 snaps. The Broncos were third in fullback usage a season ago playing Jano 142 snaps. Sufficed to say, he could see his numbers across the board doubled at least.

* **TE: Jeff Heuerman**- Heuerman is coming off the best season of his career and should hold Noah Fant off for at least the start of the season. Heuerman will have to compete with Jake Butt for this spot in camp, but as Butt is trying to come back from his third ACL tear, and Heuerman just signed a new contract, he should be the favorite here.

* **TE: Noah Fant**- The freakish first-round pick should be a monster in Rich Scangarello’s offense that elevates athletic tight ends to new heights. Fant is even more athletic than George Kittle who just set all-time tight end records in this offense just a season ago. To get an idea as to how the Broncos will use Fant, I highly recommend this video by Brett Kollmann: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TojkifD9G60

* **WR: Emmanuel Sanders**- It already appears that Sanders is 90-100% back from the Achilles tear that sidelined him for the end of the 2018 season so he should be expected to be the Broncos’ number one receiver to start the season. Sanders is the lone mentor to this young Broncos’ receiving core but being that sole veteran should lead to more trust from Flacco and therefore, more targets.

* **WR: Courtland Sutton**- Working for Mile High Sports in Denver, I’ve been banging the drum all offseason long for this Broncos receiving core and that starts with Courtland Sutton. Of all the players in the 2018 NFL Draft, few will take as big a leap from year one to year two as Courtland Sutton. 

 Musgrave’s offense kept him in a box but with Scangarello at the helm, Joe Flacco should consistently be lobbing balls up to the second-year receiver and he has the ability to come down with plenty of them.

* **WR: DaeSean Hamilton-** Hamilton began to come on for the Broncos following Demaryius Thomas’ trade and Emmanuel Sanders’ injury towards the end of the 2018 season and looked solid. He was the best pure slot receiver in the 2018 class and should fill that role for the Broncos in 2019. 

 He has reliable hands and good quickness that should make him a threat close to the line of scrimmage. He’ll likely never be an outside receiver, but he has the makeup to be one of the better slot receivers in the league in a few seasons.

* **WR: Tim Patrick-** Learn the name Tim Patrick right now. To write this series I re-watched the last four games of the Broncos’ 2018 season and there are times when Patrick is their best receiver. Once Sanders moves on (which will likely be after this season) Patrick will join Sutton on the outside and flourish. 

 He doesn’t do anything particularly flashy and he isn’t elite at anything, but he isn’t bad at anything either. He reminds me of an incredibly poor man’s Michael Thomas. Just to be absolutely clear, I’m not saying he’s Michael Thomas, just that he’s a much worse version with similar play styles but Thomas is so great that a much worse version is still solid.

* **LT: Garrett Bolles-** Bolles could be the most improved player on the team next season as he enters his third year and gets some coaching from Mike Munchak. When Bolles was drafted, it was clear he needed time to develop both mentally and physically into a pro. After adding some strength and high-end coaching, if Bolles doesn’t take a big leap in 2019, his days in Denver are likely numbered.

* **LG: Ronald Leary-** Matt Paradis’ departure leaves Leary as the lone veteran lineman left for the Broncos, who will need a much better showing out of him now. Leary arguably had the worst year of his career in 2018, but the hope is that the coaching of Mike Munchak can turn that around.

* **C: Dalton Risner-** Risner could start here or at right guard but if the Broncos were wise, they would play him here. Risner has experience playing center in college making it a more natural position for him than guard and his competition—Connor McGovern—is a better fit at guard than center.

* **RG: Connor McGovern**- McGovern made his starting debut for the Broncos last season where he was a solid guard, until Week 8 when Matt Paradis suffered a season-ending injury. McGovern then moved to center where he was among the worst offensive lineman in the league for the second half of the season. Hopefully, a move back to guard gets him on the right track.

* **RT: Ja’Wuan James**- The Broncos have had a revolving door at right tackle for a while now and each one has been pretty terrible. Jared Veldheer was the best of the bunch but even he was subpar. Now, the hope is that Ja’Wuan James can finally provide stability. James never lived up to his first-round potential with the Dolphins, but he was an above-average offensive tackle which are hard to come by in today’s NFL. With Munchak’s coaching, maybe he finally becomes the elite talent he was touted as coming out of the University of Tennessee.

* **LE: Derek Wolfe**- Wolfe has been the unsung hero for the Broncos’ defense since he was drafted in 2010. Wolfe’s interior pressure has led to countless Von Miller sacks, and he’ll now have the best teammates he’s had on the line with him in his career. Watch for Wolfe to have a career year in Fangio’s scheme.

* **NT: Shelby Harris**- According to Pro Football Focus, the Broncos best defender in 2018 was Shelby Harris, not Von Miller. Harris was dominant from the defensive end spot and should fill the role we saw Akiem Hicks in when Fangio was in the Windy City. Harris was also the man who started the breakup of Pittsburgh’s Killer B’s by intercepting Big Ben in the endzone. Few people knew about Akiem Hicks this time last season and now everyone knows him, and I anticipate Shelby Harris to have a similar rise to prominence this season.

* **RE: Adam Gotsis**- Adam Gotsis had just started playing American football when the Broncos selected him in the second round out of Georgia Tech. He was a raw prospect who’s improved every season and shined last season when finally given a starting opportunity. As Derek Wolfe ages, Gotsis is the next man up for the Broncos D line.

* **OLB: Von Miller**- Von Miller is one of the best pure pass rushers in the league alongside Khalil Mack. Now in Fangio’s defense, with the best defensive line and secondary he’s had since 2015, Von Miller is primed for a career year similar to what we saw from Mack in Chicago. Plus, with Chubb viewed more prominently throughout the league now, Miller should get the best matchups he’s seen since his first or second season in the league.

* **ILB: Todd Davis**- Davis was an average to below-average second inside linebacker behind Brandon Marshall, but now with him gone, Davis will have to step up into that number one role. Luckily for him, there’s no one better to coach him into that role than new Head Coach Vic Fangio, but don’t be surprised if the Broncos look to add another linebacker after a trial run this season.

* **ILB: Josey Jewell-** Much like Davis, Jewell is going to be asked to take a big step in 2019. Unlike Davis, Jewell has the ability to make that leap. Jewell isn’t a workout warrior, to say the least, but he has high-end instincts that always lead him to the ball. Jewell will never be able to be the lead linebacker in Denver’s 3-4 defense, but he can be the number two in it for a long time.

* **OLB: Bradley Chubb**- It sounds crazy to say, but Chubb has the potential to be even better than Von Miller has been for the Broncos. Will it happen? Probably not, but the potential is undeniably there. While Miller has long excelled as the best speed rusher in the game, Chubb has power as well. This means Chubb can hit opposing lineman with moves that Miller just doesn’t have in his arsenal, and strength also gives Chubb more upside as a run defender.

* **CB: Chris Harris Jr**.- Broncos fans were sweating when it appeared that Harris Jr. could be out the door and with good reason as he will be vital to Denver’s success this season. The AFC West is full of high-flying vertical offenses that this secondary will be tasked with stopping for six of their 16 games, and without Harris Jr. in the lineup that task goes from nearly impossible to impossible.

* **CB: Bryce Callahan**- Callahan was the best addition of the offseason for the Broncos. He’ll do a great job on the outside and in the slot and could become the Broncos’ replacement for Harris Jr. down the line. Injuries are a concern, but Callahan has gotten better with each season in Fangio’s defense and last year he is borderline elite. If he can take that next step this season, the Broncos would have one of the league’s best duos between him and Harris Jr.

* **CB: Kareem Jackson**- Jackson was another of the Broncos’ free-agent moves this offseason and his spot on the roster is more up in the air currently. As of now, the belief is that he will play strong safety when the Broncos are in their base 3-4 (which won’t be often as on 60-70%+ of snaps defenses use a sub-package), but when either Nickel or Dime looks he’ll move to the outside corner spot and push Callahan into the slot.

* **FS: Justin Simmons**- Simmons has been up-and-down through his first two seasons starting at safety, but now with his role at free safety clearer and the addition of Fangio and Donatell, he’s expected to become the future face of the secondary in 2019. 

 When Fangio got the job, the Broncos chose not to pursue free-agent safeties like Earl Thomas and Adrian Amos because Fangio believed he could turn Simmons into what Eddie Jackson became for him in Chicago. Jackson was the highest-graded safety in the NFL last season per Pro Football Focus, so watch out for Simmons.
SS: Will Parks- Parks entered the league the same year as Simmons and whenever on the field together, they’ve been a strong tandem for the Broncos that’s fun to watch. Will Parks will finally move into a “starting” role this season but will have the training wheels on as Kareem Jackson will definitely steal snaps and Su’a Cravens might as well.

* **K: Brandon McManus**- In 2018, McManus rebounded from a tough season the year prior where he only made 75% of his field goals by going 20 for 25. Though, that mark of 80% is still shy of the 85% rate he hit in both 2015 and 2016. 

 It also should be noted that 2018 was McManus’ worst season ever from 50+ yards, while simultaneously being his best season from fewer than 50. On kicks fewer than 50 yards including field goals, McManus was 53/53. On-field goal attempts greater than 50 yards, McManus was 2/7 or 28.6% which is an outlier for his career, as in his second-worst season from he went 50% from 50+.

* **P: Colby Wadman**- The Broncos signed Wadman to be a replacement for Marquette King when he flamed out. Wadman is a solid, but below-average punter for the Broncos and I was surprised to see them stick with him this offseason. The Broncos must regret moving Riley Dixon to get Marquette King now, as Dixon was certainly better than Wadman.

* **Returner: Brendan Langley**- Langley is one of the few remaining players on the Broncos’ roster from their infamously terrible 2017 draft class. The other remaining players—Bolles, Demarcus Walker, and Butt—are all either in danger of getting cut either this August or next and the same goes for Langley. 

 Langley burned out at cornerback and is now attempting to move back to wide receiver. While there’s a chance he revives his career at the new position, his better chance of making the roster is as a return man thanks to his high-end athleticism.

**Positional Strengths/Weaknesses**

* **Quarterback:** As I’ve already said in this paper, the addition of Joe Flacco should give the Broncos are a slight but noticeable upgrade over Case Keenum, just how Keenum gave a slight but noticeable upgrade over Trevor Siemian. 

 Flacco will be in an offense that fits him better and the Mile-High air should be kind to the Howitzer connected to his right shoulder. That being said, Flacco is still the 20th-22nd best quarterback in the league meaning the Broncos won’t be truly competitive until they find a real franchise quarterback, especially not in the AFC West. 

 They hope they have one with Drew Lock but the longer he sits, the better. In a perfect world, the Broncos would sit Lock until Week 16 or 17 (barring a surprising wild card run) and then get him a few starts before allowing him to take over in 2020. Similar to how Andy Reid tackled Alex Smith and Patrick Mahomes.

* **Backfield:** The Broncos could soon have the best running back tandem in the league now with Mark Ingram leaving Alvin Kamara and the Saints. They believe that Royce Freeman is their bell-cow back who will get the bulk of the carries, while Phillip Lindsay is their lightning-quick matchup nightmare. 

 Using Kyle Shanahan’s offense, the plan is to lean heavily on the two young backs on the ground and through the air.

 Don’t be surprised when both backs go for over 1,000 yards from scrimmage this season (In 2018, Lindsay had 1,278 Y.F.S., Freeman had 593). Devontae Booker finds himself as the odd man out fighting for a roster spot with scat backs Khalfani Muhammad and Devontae Jackson who are cheaper and could provide more upside.

* **Offensive Line:** The offensive line has been a weak point for the Broncos for over five years, but the 2019 unit has a solid chance to turn things around. 

 Although the departure of Matt Paradis hurts, the Broncos have added a gritty rookie in Dalton Risner who was widely expected to go in the first round and could start from day one. Connor McGovern should return to right guard where he was an above-average starter for Denver a season ago. Left guard Ronald Leary is back after an injury-riddled season, but the Broncos feel good about the depth they have behind him in Elijah Wilkinson. 

 The tackle spots should be the best they’ve been in recent memory with Ja’Wuan James being a colossal upgrade over the right tackles of years past, while Garrett Bolles is primed for a huge leap under Mike Munchak after another year of both physical and mental growth and development. The squad won’t be a top ten line in 2019, but if they can find a left guard of the future and Garrett Bolles takes the leap he should, the Broncos would be positioned to have one of the league’s better lines for the foreseeable future.

* **Pass Catchers:** For a long time, the Broncos had Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, and then no tight ends or receivers behind them to help take some weight off their shoulders. That is no longer case thanks to the incredible depth of young pass-catchers in Denver. The Broncos don’t have the top-end talent of the Vikings or even the Raiders, Chiefs, or Chargers in their division, but they may have a deeper group than all of them. 

 At wide receiver, Emmanuel Sanders will have one more season as the unquestioned number one guy and he should finally have a quarterback who can get the ball to him consistently. Courtland Sutton is ready to emerge as one of the league’s best young receivers in Scangarello’s scheme and fellow member of the 2018 draft class DaeSean Hamilton should be Denver’s slot receiver for a long time. 

 Meanwhile, Tim Patrick is one of the best number four receivers in the league, and the Broncos also have boom-or-bust prospect Juwann Winfree, cornerback-turned-receiver Brendan Langley who offers a lot in terms of athleticism, and River Cracraft who played meaningful snaps in 2018 all on the depth chart at receiver. 

 Then, at tight end, the Broncos have another deep position group without a dominant number one but plenty of potential. Heuerman is the lone tight-end no longer on his rookie deal but he’s still fairly young and is coming off his best season. Fant could become a superstar in this offense if he refines his game due to his off-the-charts athleticism. Seriously, comparing combine numbers he’s closer to former Pro Bowl receiver Vincent Jackson than your average tight end. 

 Then you will have Jake Butt and Troy Fumagalli likely competing for that third and final roster spot. Jake Butt is coming off his third ACL tear, and it’s yet to be seen if he’ll be able to recover, but prior to his injury, he was the best tight end on the roster last season. Fumagalli is the man to watch at Broncos’ training camp. He missed his rookie season with a sports hernia, but he stood out from the rest of the group at OTAs earlier this summer.

* **Defensive Line:** Much like the offensive line, the defensive line should be the best it’s been in recent years. Derek Wolfe should continue to be steady-eddy on the defense, pressuring the quarterback and stopping the run, while Shelby Harris emerges as the star of the defensive line in Fangio’s first season. Adam Gotsis will continue to develop and will rotate out with Zach Kerr in obvious run situations due to Kerr’s size and run-stuffing ability. 

 In obvious passing situations, the Broncos have an assortment of pass-rushing weapons they can use on the defensive line next to Miller and Chubb, with rookie Dre’Mont Jones and 2017 second-rounder Demarcus Walker offering interior pass rush ability along with Wolfe, Harris, and Gotsis.

* **Linebackers:** As much as the defensive line and secondary should elevate under Vic Fangio, no unit should improve more than the linebackers. 

 Josey Jewell now has a year of experience under his belt and should be the odds-on favorite to lead the team in tackles. Todd Davis will help Jewell in swallowing up run plays, but both, especially Davis, will leave a lot to be desired in coverage and passing situations. Behind them, the Broncos have a bunch of young linebackers waiting for an opportunity, from last year’s sixth-round pick Keishawn Bierria to former Tennessee star linebacker A.J. Johnson who took two years off of football before last season fighting a false rape accusation. 

 Meanwhile, Miller and Chubb should have career years under Fangio just like most pass-rushing linebackers do. I’d put 30 combined sacks as the floor for this incredibly gifted duo as they’ll have far more snaps than last year considering Ray and Barrett’s departure. Watch for Jeff Holland and rookie Justin Hollins to fill those rotational pass rushing roles left behind, though they should get far less usage than either Ray or Barrett did.

* **Secondary:** The Broncos may have lost Bradley Roby and Tramaine Brock but with Kareem Jackson and Bryce Callahan joining Chris Harris Jr. the Broncos now have three top-five cornerbacks in the eyes of PFF. 

 This may be Harris Jr.’s swan song season with the Broncos, but under Ed Donatell’s tutelage, it should be an excellent one. Bryce Callahan should immediately thrive in this system as he’s spent his entire career in it already. Meanwhile, Kareem Jackson will provide veteran leadership to both the young corners behind him like Isaac Yiadom and De’Vante Bausby and young safeties Will Parks and Justin Simmons. 

 Speaking of Simmons, he’s on the list of Broncos along with Courtland Sutton and Garrett Bolles most ready to take a huge step in 2019, as he steps into the Eddie Jackson role in Fangio’s defense. Will Parks will have some up and down moments in his first season starting but based on the glimpses we’ve already seen it should be more positive than negative. 

 Su’a Cravens is the greatest mystery on the Broncos’ roster. He has talent, the Broncos invested a decent amount in him, and they have a need for his skills, on the flip side Cravens was arguably their worst defender last season which led to his benching, and it seems they don’t know how to use him. I believe a position change back to linebacker would suit Cravens best, but if he makes the roster the Broncos will find a way to get him on the field wherever that may be. 


* **Special Teams:** Denver's special teams were one of the worst units in the league last season and there isn’t much chance of improvement heading into 2019. Kicker Brandon McManus should continue to bounce back from a dismal 2017 season, and Colby Wadman might be slightly improved given a full training camp with the team, but odds are they’ll be more or less the same as they were in 2018. 

Returner still continues to plague the Broncos, as once again it’s a complete mystery who will be returning kicks and punts for them this season and it’s a responsibility that will almost definitely be moved around a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**2015:**

* Brandon Scherrff with the 5th overall pick. Excellent guard who just gets overshadowed by Martin and Yanda often.
* Preston Smith with the 38th overall pick. Very underrated defensive end who's value doesn't show up on the stat sheet. Very happy he's now with my Packers.

**2016:**

* Josh Doctson and Sua Cravens have both been busts.

**2017**:

* Jonathan Allen with the 17th overall pick. Projected top 5 at the time and fell to 17. Really good player, especially in the run game.
* Ryan Anderson with the 49th overall pick. Hard to tell because he hasn't played much but I'm guessing he's just a role player.

**2018**:

* Daron Payne with the 13th overall pick. Made the all rookie team in 2018 and looks to be a very good defensive tackle.
* Derrius Guice with the 59th overall pick. It's a shame he's been injured the whole time because I think he's going to be a really good running back and I thought he was a steal in the mid second round last year.

**2019**:

* Dwayne Haskins with the 15th overall pick. He was projected top 10 on most mock drafts and many people thought he was the 2nd best qb after Kyler. Still shocked he slipped to 15 with the type of year he had at Ohio State. 50 TD and 8 INT is no joke, especially lighting up Michigan's great defense for over 60 points.
* Montez Sweat with the 26th overall pick. Another guy who was projected to go as high as top 10 with most being 10-20 range. Could be a huge steal for where he was picked.",nfl,KingMeruem12,75,2019-07-18

My name is Jacob, and I have decided to create ""Reddit Version Football"", which will be a simulation of the 2019 Season and beyond. This simulation will be more detailed than a regular prediction during the season, dealing with roster cuts, rosters, staffs, and offseason duties. So now let me get to the main point of the making of this simulation. The simulation will begin the making of roster cuts. We would propose the final 53 team rosters and have a list of the released free agents sorted by position. Then every week during the season, people here on Reddit will vote on the games. I have already designed an injury simulator that would provide injuries during the season, but if it's disliked we can take it out. After the season and post-season, we can continue past the 2019 season. The thing we need right now is people to help out with this simulation. The smallest amount of help is amazing, and if you're interested in this or have any questions, click on the link below. Thank You!!

396,(OC) What if the NFL eliminated the last-place franchise after each season?,"This is inspired by my posts about [the NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9g6ss9/oc_what_if_the_nba_eliminated_the_lastplace/), [NHL](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/9gbrsh/oc_what_if_the_nhl_eliminated_the_lastplace/), and [MLB](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/afb52j/oc_what_if_MLB_eliminated_the_lastplace_franchise/).

What could raise the stakes (and lower the incentive for “rebuilding”) more than the threat of a team’s complete deletion from existence? In this alternate reality, the NFL removes the franchise that comes in last each season. This means the league continuously shrinks until there is just one team left.

In order to find that one team, we’ll say that this system started 31 seasons ago (as there are 32 teams). We’ll use their real-world records to determine who the eliminated franchise is. At the same time, we’ll guess who the Super Bowl matchups and eventual champions would be for each year by finding the best non-eliminated team.

Now, ideally, I’d only look at the games that non-eliminated teams played against each other. However, it’s incredibly difficult to sift through, say, 20 teams’ schedules to look for their records against *each other* by removing their results against the 12 teams that no longer exist. I have no idea how to do that efficiently. Instead, I will use their full, real-world, 16-game records for the first 24 seasons. Then, when there are just 8 teams left, I will only use their records *against each other* as if they were the only teams in the league. However, if one of those teams played no games against other surviving teams, I will compare the teams using their complete 16 game schedules in order to be as fair as possible.

The Redskins are the only remaining team in the NFL East.** Because neither the Patriots nor the Panthers exist, the Super Bowl will be between the teams from each conference that got furthest in the real-world playoffs. In the AFC, that team is the Chiefs (who made it to the Divisional round) and in the NFC it is a tie between the Rams and Packers. Because the Rams had the better regular season record, they win the tiebreaker. However, the Chiefs win the tiebreaker over the Rams for the championship. **The *Chiefs* win Super Bowl XXXVIII over the *Rams* in the Missouri Bowl.**

So what changed in this world?

The Bills and Vikings won Super Bowls, while the Patriots, Seahawks, Saints, and Eagles never win one.

The Rams, Chiefs, Bears, Ravens, and Broncos each won an extra Super Bowl. 

The Steelers won an extra 5 Super Bowls (giving them eleven total), and the Packers won an extra 3 Super Bowls (giving them 7 total). The last two remaining teams end up being the two teams with the most Super Bowl championships.

397,[OC] What if the NFL eliminated the last-place franchise after each season?,"This is inspired by my posts about [the NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9g6ss9/oc_what_if_the_nba_eliminated_the_lastplace/), [NHL](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/9gbrsh/oc_what_if_the_nhl_eliminated_the_lastplace/), and [MLB](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/afb52j/oc_what_if_MLB_eliminated_the_lastplace_franchise/).

What could raise the stakes (and lower the incentive for “rebuilding”) more than the threat of a team’s complete deletion from existence? In this alternate reality, the NFL removes the franchise that comes in last each season. This means the league continuously shrinks until there is just one team left.

In order to find that one team, we’ll say that this system started 31 seasons ago (as there are 32 teams). We’ll use their real-world records to determine who the eliminated franchise is. At the same time, we’ll guess who the Super Bowl matchups and eventual champions would be for each year by finding the best non-eliminated team.

Now, ideally, I’d only look at the games that non-eliminated teams played against each other. However, it’s incredibly difficult to sift through, say, 20 teams’ schedules to look for their records against *each other* by removing their results against the 12 teams that no longer exist. I have no idea how to do that efficiently. Instead, I will use their full, real-world, 16-game records for the first 24 seasons. Then, when there are just 8 teams left, I will only use their records *against each other* as if they were the only teams in the league. However, if one of those teams played no games against other surviving teams, I will compare the teams using their complete 16 game schedules in order to be as fair as possible.

**1988 (Year One):** The Dallas Cowboys come in last place in the NFL at 3-13. To repeat, I only began this season because it was 31 years ago, not because it eliminates the Cowboys immediately. That’s just a nice coincidence. **The Cowboys are permanently removed from the NFL.** The Super Bowl is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The 49ers win Super Bowl XXIII over the Bengals.**

**1993 (Year Six):** The Cincinnati Bengals come in last place in the league at 3-13. **The Bengals are permanently removed from the NFL.** Once again, the real-world champion Cowboys have been eliminated, so runner-up Bills take the championship and the NFC runner-up 49ers win the NFC. **The *Bills* win Super Bowl XXVIII over the *49ers*.

407,"[OC] Playoff Parity, Turnover, and Repeat Appearances","Making the playoffs in the NFL is a prestigious opportunity. Only 12 out of the 32 teams get to do it every year, 6 from each conference. That much is obvious. But what I'm trying to get to the bottom of is how likely it is for my team, your team, or any team, to go to the playoffs again this upcoming season. Of course circumstances matter, and this won't apply to every team (such as the Patriots). 

&amp;#x200B;

To start we have to first see what teams have made the playoffs. Since the realignment in 2002, every team has made the playoffs at least once, and 24 out of the 32 teams have made the playoffs in consecutive years. The teams who have not made it more than once in a row:

&amp;#x200B;

Redskins (4 playoff berths)

&amp;#x200B;

Jaguars (3 playoff berths)

&amp;#x200B;

Lions (3 playoff berths)

&amp;#x200B;

Buccaneers (3 playoff berths)

&amp;#x200B;

Dolphins (2 playoff berths)

&amp;#x200B;

Raiders (2 playoff berths)

&amp;#x200B;

Browns (1 playoff berth, so it literally would be impossible to repeat appearances)

&amp;#x200B;

Bills (also only 1 playoff berth)

&amp;#x200B;

For your information, this just means that these teams have made the playoffs, but have not went more than once in a row. For example, the Redskins may have made the playoffs 4 times in 17 years, but the appearances are all spread out (2005, 2007, 2012, 2015). Here is a Microsoft Paint illustration of playoff seeding since 2002: [https://imgur.com/a/R6tqW3I](https://imgur.com/a/R6tqW3I)

&amp;#x200B;

From this illustration we can derive many stats and tables. Here's an easy one, ongoing streaks of playoff appearances. If a team went to the playoffs this year, they have an active streak:

&amp;#x200B;

|Team|Streak (# of seasons)|
|:-|:-|
|Patriots|10|
|Chiefs|4|
|Eagles|2|
|Rams|2|
|Saints|2|
|Texans|1|
|Ravens|1|
|Chargers|1|
|Colts|1|
|Bears|1|
|Cowboys|1|
|Seahawks|1|

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably not a fun table to look at. If it weren't for 2008 the Patriots might even have a 16 season playoff streak. The Andy Reid-led Chiefs have been a pretty good model of consistency like the Andy Reid Eagles were in the 2000s. The Eagles back-to-back playoff berths have been wildly different and are no indicator that they will repeat again; 2017 was based on the MVP caliber season of Wentz and 2018 was a mediocre season in the making, until Nick Foles clutched them out from the depths of 6-7 to 9-7. The Rams back-to-back streak is based off the pairing of Sean McVay and Jared Goff, as well as Gurley, an elite trio of wide receivers, and a pretty damn good defense. The Saints back-to-back is based on the elite level of Drew Brees and Sean Payton. The rest of the teams were not in the playoffs in 2017, but made it in 2018, for various reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it quite interesting that the Super Bowl defending champion as well as the top 2 seeds in each conference are the teams with active playoff streaks. Which begs the question, how many teams each year have active playoff streaks? AKA how many teams make repeat appearances in the playoffs? Well here's the table year-to-year. 2002 is not used in the table because it is the first year of data. I could have used 2001's playoff data but that messes up a perfect number at the end. You'll see in a minute. The repeat appearances column entails the number of teams who were in the playoffs the year before. For example, 2003 has 4 repeat appearances, meaning 4 teams that were in the 2003 playoffs were also in the 2002 playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Repeat Appearances|AFC|NFC|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2003|4|2|2|
|2004|7|3|4|
|2005|5|4|1|
|2006|5|2|3|
|2007|6|3|3|
|2008|5|4|1|
|2009|6|3|3|
|2010|7|4|3|
|2011|6|3|3|
|2012|8|4|4|
|2013|7|4|3|
|2014|7|4|3|
|2015|8|4|4|
|2016|6|4|2|
|2017|4|3|1|
|2018|5|2|3|

&amp;#x200B;

And here's the perfect number: on average, in the 16 years of data, (the average comes out to exactly...) 6 teams make repeat appearances every year. In the AFC, approximately 3.3 teams make repeat appearances the following year. In the NFC, approximately 2.7 teams make repeat appearances the following year. As a result, it can be seen that the NFC has more parity than the AFC. Oh well the AFC still has a better color scheme in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

 A minimum of 4 teams and a maximum of 8 teams make repeat appearances between seasons. I bring up this data because it feels like so many analysts and people doing their power rankings have the exact same 12 teams from the 2018 playoffs as their top 12 (with maybe the Browns snuck in there as a dark horse). But we have to remember, this is the NFL, and ANYTHING can happen between seasons. So out of the Patriots, Chiefs, Texans, Ravens, Chargers, Colts, Saints, Rams, Bears, Cowboys, Seahawks, and Eagles, AT LEAST 4 of those teams are out, and 4 new teams step in their place. Of course it could be the average of 6 new teams, or the highest of 8 new teams. Despite you viewers not caring about my opinion, I think 7 teams are going to repeat in the 2019 playoffs - the Patriots, Chiefs, Colts, Chargers, Saints, Rams, and Eagles. The 5 new teams will be the Falcons, Vikings, Steelers, Browns (don't worry I think if they do make it they're losing in the WC), and Packers.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a new thought may jump into your head: the Patriots, Chiefs, Saints, and Rams were all top 2 seeds in their conference, does this mean they're really likely to make the playoffs next year? Of course team circumstances make the answer ambiguous, but the probability is pretty good. Each repeat appearance column is out of 32, and the AFC and NFC columns are out of 16.

&amp;#x200B;

|Seed|Repeat Appearances|AFC|NFC|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|22|13|9|
|2|17|10|7|
|3|13|9|4|
|4|15|8|7|
|5|16|7|9|
|6|13|8|5|

&amp;#x200B;

I found this extremely weird and interesting. I think the third seed is cursed in the NFC. Besides that, 1st seeds have had an pretty high likelihood of making the playoffs the next year, especially in the AFC. Chiefs fans got nothing to worry about. This is another showing of how the AFC is more top heavy and the NFC is extremely competitive for playoff spots that switch around every year.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I'd like to present my final table, which entails the repeat appearances of every team. The Redskins, Jaguars, Lions, Buccaneers, Dolphins, Raiders, Browns, and Bills are not included because they have never had a repeat appearance in the playoffs, as mentioned much earlier. Keep in mind the amount of playoff berths is out of 17, but the repeat appearances is out of 16 because 2002 does not count in the dataset. The makeup column is how a team's playoff berths are distributed, and a dash represents a year or multiple years where a team missed the playoffs. For example, the Patriots had a streak of 5 playoff berths, then missed the playoffs in 2008, and currently have a streak of 10 playoff berths, so their makeup is 5-10. A team's longest streak of playoff berths in a row can also be seen in the makeup, like the Patriots whose longest streak is 10. Weird, but a cool way to see how consistent your team can or cannot be

What can be seen from this is the inconsistency of the Cowboys as well as the sporadic dominance of the Steelers and Saints. 12 of these teams have active streaks that they can use to increase their repeat appearances and pad their makeup. What I want to prove from all these tables is that there is like a 50% chance your team stays in the 2019 playoffs or gets kicked out for another team for pretty much no reason, based on probability and recent history. No matter how good your team is, the NFL is a cruel place and you could get kicked out of the playoffs anyway. But it's ok, because this won't happen to MY team, right?

So based on past data, anywhere from 12 to 17 teams will finish below 500 next year (7-8-1 or worse)
Who are these teams?

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 52: 1971 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 19, 1971-January 16, 1972

Teams: 26

1971 NFL Draft: 442 selections (17 rounds), held in New York City, NY.

1971 First Draft Pick: Jim Plunkett, Quarterback from Stanford University (New England Patriots)

1971 AP Most Valuable Player: Alan Page, Defensive Tackle (Minnesota Vikings)

Super Bowl VI: Dallas Cowboys (NFC) defeated Miami Dolphins (AFC) 24-3 at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, LA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-Teams will not be charged a time out for an injured player unless the injury occurs inside the last two minutes of a half or overtime.

\-Missed field goal attempts can be run back.

Prior to the 1971 season, a lot of changes were made. The Boston Patriots changed their name to the New England Patriots. The season also saw a few teams relocate to new stadiums for their home games. Patriots (Schaefer Stadium), Bears (Soldier Field), Eagles (Veterans Stadium), 49ers (Candlestick Park), and Cowboys (Texas Stadium).

The division format remained the same from the previous season, with 3 division champions and 1 wild card per conference for the 8-team playoffs. 

The playoff qualifiers were (please note the wild card qualifiers\*):

**-NFC East:** Dallas Cowboys (11-3-0), Washington Redskins (9-4-1)\*

\-**NFC Central:** Minnesota Vikings (11-3-0)

\-**NFC West:** San Francisco 49ers (9-5-0)

\-**AFC East:** Miami Dolphins (10-3-1), Baltimore Colts (10-4-0)\*

\-**AFC Central:** Cleveland Browns (9-5-0)

\-**AFC West:** Kansas City Chiefs (10-3-1)

Continuing the format used until 1975, home field was alternated each season between division winners regardless of the record.

**Divisional Playoffs**

Dallas Cowboys defeated Minnesota Vikings 20-12 at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, MN.

Miami Dolphins defeated Kansas City Chiefs 27-24 (2OT) at Municipal Stadium in Kansas City, MO. (The longest game eve played at 82 minutes, 40 seconds)

Baltimore Colts defeated Cleveland Browns 20-3 at Cleveland Stadium in Cleveland, OH.

San Francisco 49ers defeated Washington Redskins 24-20 at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, CA.

**Conference Championships**

NFC Championship Game: Dallas Cowboys defeated San Francisco 49ers 14-3 at Texas Stadium in Irving, TX.

AFC Championship Game: Miami Dolphins defeated Baltimore Colts 21-0 at Miami Orange Bowl in Miami, FL.

**Super Bowl VI**

The Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins competed in Super Bowl VI held at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, LA. The attendance was 81,023 with CBS broadcasting the game. The Cowboys were 6 point favorites.

Miami won the coin toss and elected to receive. Neither team could mount a drive on its first possession. On the first play of the Dolphins' second possession, Larry Csonka, on his first carry of the game, gained 12 yards on a sweep aided by a big block by Larry Little on Herb Adderley. That would be his longest gain of the day. On the next play, Csonka fumbled a handoff from Bob Griese, his first fumble of the season, and it was recovered by linebacker Chuck Howley at the Cowboys 48-yard line. Runs by Walt Garrison put Dallas within field goal range, but Staubach was sacked by Jim Riley and Bob Heinz for a 12-yard loss. However, Staubach found Bob Hayes open for a pass and then Staubach passed to Duane Thomas for first and goal. On 3rd and goal, Dick Anderson made a great play to keep Thomas out of the end zone. Dallas kicker Mike Clark kicked a 9-yard field goal to give the Cowboys a 3–0 lead.

On the third play of the Dolphins' next possession at their own 38-yard line, Griese was sacked by Bob Lilly for a Super Bowl record record 29-yard loss, which still stands as the longest negative play from scrimmage in Super Bowl history.

Early in the second quarter, Miami drove to the Cowboys 42-yard line with the aid of a 20-yard reception by receiver Howard Twilley, but the drive stalled and ended with no points after kicker Garo Yepremian missed a 49-yard field goal attempt.

Starting with 6:15 left in the period, Dallas drove 76 yards in 10 plays, including a 21-yard reception by Lance Alworth and Calvin Hill's three carries for 25 yards, and then scored on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Staubach to Alworth to increase their lead to 10–0. Miami started the ensuing drive with just 1:15 left in the half, and quarterback Bob Griese completed three consecutive passes, two to receiver Paul Warfield and one to running back Jim Kiick, for 44 total yards to reach the Dallas 24-yard line. On the next play Griese threw to Warfield, who was open at the 2-yard line, but the ball was deflected by Green and bounced off Warfield's chest. Miami had to settle for Yepremian's 31-yard field goal to cut the Dolphins deficit to 10–3 going into halftime.

But Dallas dominated the second half, preventing any chance of a Miami comeback. Dallas reasoned that Miami would make adjustments to stop the Cowboys' inside running game which had been so successful in the first half. So the Cowboys decided to run outside. The Cowboys opened the third period with a 71-yard, 8-play drive, which included four runs by Thomas for 37 yards, a reverse by Hayes for 16 yards, and only one pass, scoring on Thomas' 3-yard sweep to make the score 17–3. This seemed to fire up the Dallas defense, who managed to prevent Miami from getting a single first down in the entire third quarter. The farthest advance Miami had in the third quarter was to its own 42-yard line as Griese and the offense were, as Don Shula put it, ""destroyed."" On an incomplete pass, Jake Scott hit Roger Staubach on a blitz that shook him up late in the third quarter, but Staubach returned in the fourth.

Miami managed to advance to midfield early in the final period, opening the fourth quarter with their first third down conversion of the game. Howley ended the drive, however, by intercepting a pass from Griese intended for Kiick in the flat. After returning the ball 41 yards, Howley tripped and fell at the Dolphins 9-yard line with no one near him. But three plays later, Staubach threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mike Ditka, increasing the Dallas lead to 24–3 with twelve minutes left in the game.

Miami began their next possession at their own 23-yard line and mounted only their third sustained drive of the game, reaching the Dallas 16-yard line in six plays. However, Griese fumbled the snap and the ball was recovered by Cowboys left end Larry Cole at the 20-yard line. The Cowboys then mounted an eleven-play drive to the Miami 1-yard line which featured just one pass and a fake field goal attempt on 4th and 1 at the Miami 20-yard line. However, on 1st and goal at the 1-yard line, Hill fumbled while attempting to dive across the goal line, and the ball was recovered at the 4-yard line by Dolphins defensive tackle Manny Fernandez with just under two minutes left. Miami then ran four meaningless plays to end the game.

The Dallas Cowboys became the first team to win the Super Bowl after losing it the previous year. The Miami Dolphins would duplicate this feat the following season by winning Super Bowl VII. This would be the only game the Dolphins would lose in 1972, going undefeated the next season prior to their Super Bowl VII win. Miami's 3 points scored set a Super Bowl record, which was tied by the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII in 2019.

Brady played a relatively poor game (at least by his standards) in SB 53, but still won because his defense gave up only 3 points. It now seems that there is a lot of chatter, especially on this sub, that Belichick could make nearly any other decent Quarterback a multi-time, or even more than 6-time Super Bowl Champion After all, even Blaine Gabbert probably could have won Super Bowl 53, provided he could hand the ball off to Sony Michel and the defense still only gave up 3 points again. 

So, my point is that despite winning SB 53, the game seemed to change the narrative to BB being the mastermind behind the Patriots 2 decade run of dominance, and that the ""system"" in place is why they are so successful, effectively harming Bradys legacy.

His 2013 campaign will always be remembered as an all-time great, but it's hard to separate that season with its absolute disaster of an ending.

If the Broncos had won SB 48, Peytons 2013 season would surely be regarded as the greatest QB season of all time and he would have certainly been viewed as significantly ahead of Brady in the GOAT race at the time (as Brady only had 3 rings in 2013 and hadn't won one in almost 10 years).

The Vince Lombardi Trophy stands 22 inches (56 cm) tall, weighs 7 pounds (3.2 kg) and depicts a football in a kicking position on a three concave sided stand, and is entirely made of sterling silver.[10]

The words ""Vince Lombardi Trophy"" along with the Roman numerals of that year's Super Bowl are engraved on and the NFL shield is affixed onto the base. After the trophy is awarded, it is sent back to Tiffany's to be engraved with the names of the participating teams, the date, location, and the game's final score.[11] It is then sent back to the winning team for them to keep. Smaller replicas are made for each person on the winning team.

For the first four championship games, both the NFL and the AFL logos were in the center of the trophy. Starting from Super Bowl V, only the NFL shield was on the front. Beginning with Super Bowl XXXVIII, the shield took on a frosted appearance. Starting with Super Bowl XLIII, the slightly redesigned NFL shield began appearing on the trophy, still with a frosted appearance. Other than the logo, the trophy has had no significant changes made since the first Super Bowl. While no franchise possesses all four versions, the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, New York Giants, and Pittsburgh Steelers have three of the four designs.",nfl,GaryNunchucks,0,2019-07-19

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Carolina Panthers.**

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The only possible quarterback to choose from here was Cam Newton. No way was I going to put Chris Weinke or Jimmy Clausen at QB; it had to be Cam Newton, so he takes up the first round spot rather easily. After that, I looked at the rounds where my hands were my hands were tied, and where I really only had one option to choose from. This applied in round three with Steve Smith at wide receiver, round four with Frank Garcia on the offensive line, round six with Jeno James on the offensive line, and in the 7+ spot with Kris Mangum at tight end. With a young franchise and small sample sizes for each round, there were a lot of obvious spots where there was only one good option.

Having said that, I’ve got to fill up the second round and the fifth round, and need a halfback plus anyone besides a QB. Only two good options for the second round emerged, with those options being Ryan Kalil on the offensive line and Muhsin Muhammad at wide receiver. Because of that, I figured that I should use the fifth round spot on a halfback, going with Cameron Artis-Payne. Every good halfback in franchise history was drafted in the first round, so the running game was going to suffer regardless of what I did here. And, with the second round, I opted for Muhammad over Kalil, figuring that the best way for this team to win games is for a two-headed monster at wide receiver (arguably the best WR combo in the early 2000s besides Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne). They needed one position where they could stand out from the other teams; adding Ryan Kalil to the offensive line wouldn’t do that, but adding Muhsin Muhammad to the receivers would.

**Defense:** First, I looked at the obvious rounds where there was a clear gap between one player and the rest of the competition. Greg Hardy in round six fit that bill on the defensive line, as did Josh Norman in the secondary in round five, Kris Jenkins in round two on the defensive line, and Captain Munnerlyn in the secondary in the 7+ spot. Already, we’ve got half the team picked out. Looking at the available linebackers (since I still don’t have a linebacker picked for this team), all of the good ones are in round one. The defensive line is pretty set with Jenkins and Hardy, so adding a guy like Julius Peppers won’t do as much as adding Luke Kuechly in the first round. You might think that this completely contradicts what I said earlier in my Muhammad/Kalil justification; however, the difference here is that the Carolina offensive line, even without Kalil, still has players that are halfway decent and serviceable. If I didn’t put Kuechly in the first round spot, then the team would literally fall apart at linebacker and have bench quality players.

Now, with two rounds left, I needed a linebacker and a joker. There were two combinations that went through my mind. One of them was to put Will Witherspoon at linebacker in round three and Tre Boston at defensive back in round four. The other was to put Hannibal Navies at linebacker in round four and Charles Johnson at defensive end in round three. In the end, I opted for the second option. Simply put, of the four players listed, the only one to have a truly great tenure with the Panthers was Charles Johnson, so choosing the option that involved him, even if it meant suffering a bit at linebacker, made the most sense. I could’ve gone with two average players, or a below average player and a really good player; I went with option two.

**Final Thoughts**

There are some good things about this team, even if it is only 25 years old. The pass rush is really good, they have one of the best linebackers in recent memory in Luke Kuechly, they have an incredible 1-2 combination at wide receiver in Muhammad and Smith, and have an MVP quarterback in Cam Newton who is mobile. However, it’s evident where this team struggles. The running game is poor, the offensive line is mediocre at best, and there are some players that are in this starting lineup that really aren’t better than backup quality. Still, this team may be able to take a game in the tournament with the right matchup.

464,"[OC] In Dennis Green’s 10 seasons with the Vikings, he made the playoffs 8 times with 7 different quarterbacks.","What Dennis Green did without a lot of stability at the quarterback position was remarkable and probably won’t be duplicated in the current era of franchise quarterbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

During his time in Minnesota he had 10 different quarterbacks start for him, 2 of which were Spergon Wynn and Todd Bouman in his final season, where he was fired before Week 17. A rundown of each year’s quarterback situation:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1992** – Rich Gannon starts 12 games and Sean Salisbury 4. He inherits Gannon and Salisbury from the previous year’s team and chooses Gannon as the Week 1 starter. Green benches Gannon before their Week 13 game against the Rams. Gannon would start one more game in Week 15 against the 49ers, but Salisbury would get the start in their Wild Card playoff game. Salisbury goes 6-20 with 113 yards passing and 2 interceptions in his only career playoff start. He would later get paid millions to analyze professional quarterback play on national television.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1993** – The Vikings bring in Super Bowl winning former Chicago Bears QB Jim McMahon to be their starter for the season. McMahon starts 12 games and Salisbury the other 4. McMahon starts for them in the playoffs, a 17-10 loss to the New York Giants. McMahon would only start one more game for the rest of his career, a 32-0 loss to the Browns when he played for Buddy Ryan’s Cardinals, but would win another Super Bowl as a backup quarterback for the Packers before retiring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1994** – Dennis Green and the Vikings decide not to bring back McMahon and sign 37-year-old Warren Moon to be their starter. He starts 15 games for them, with Salisbury starting the only other game. Salisbury plays for an injured Warren Moon, hobbled by a sprained left knee, and wins against the 49ers in Week 17, clinching the team’s 3rd straight playoff appearance under Green. Moon gets the start and, in his final career playoff appearance, loses to Steve Walsh, Dave Wannstedt, and the 1994 Chicago Bears in the Wild Card round. The Bears would get blown out by the eventual Super Bowl champion 49ers the next week and would not win another playoff game until their Super Bowl run with Lovie Smith in 2006.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1995** – The Vikings finally get stability at the quarterback position with 38-year-old Warren Moon starting all 16 games for them. Moon has a great statistical season with over 4,000 yards passing and 33 TDs to 14 INTs. The Vikings offense finishes the season 4th in points scored but 27th in points allowed and misses the playoffs for the first time in the Dennis Green era with a record of 8-8.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1996** – Warren Moon returns as the Vikings starting quarterback, but is mostly injured and ineffective. After suffering a broken collarbone in a Week 11 loss to the Seahawks, longtime team backup Brad Johnson becomes the team’s starter for the rest of the season, with both quarterbacks starting 8 games each for the season. Johnson was a 9th round pick for the Vikings, back when they had that many rounds. Johnson hung on as the team’s 3rd string quarterback for the entirety of Green’s tenure, except for a brief stint he spent with the London Monarchs of the now defunct NFL Europe. Johnson goes 5-3 as a starter, good enough get the Vikings a playoff spot at 9-7. Johnson’s first career playoff start is a 40-15 loss in the Wild Card round to the Dallas Cowboys, who would not win another playoff game until beating the Eagles in the Wild Card round in January 2010. They would lose their next playoff game that year to…the Vikings, led by Brett Favre.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1997** – Warren Moon has now moved on to the Seattle Seahawks, where he will be their starter for the next 2 seasons. Based on his success last season, Brad Johnson is the Week 1 starter for the Vikings and will start 13 games for the team. In the 1997 offseason, however, the Vikings made one of their biggest moves of the Dennis Green era by bringing in quarterback Randall Cunningham. Cunningham had been out of football the previous season, having retired from the Eagles after being reduced to a backup role in favor of Rodney Peete in 1995. Johnson leads the team to an 8-4 record and, apropos of nothing, becomes the first player in NFL history to catch his own deflected pass and run it in for a touchdown in Week 7. Before his 13th start of the season, a MNF game against the Packers, he wakes up with neck pain the morning of the game. It is learned later on that he was suffering from a bulging disc between his 5th and 6th vertebrae, severely affecting his grip, and leading him to throw multiple errant passes that night. He is benched late in the game for Randall Cunningham, who would start the Vikings final 3 regular season games and their postseason game. For the first time in the Dennis Green era the Vikings get a postseason victory, defeating Danny Kanell and the 10-5-1 New York Giants on a last second field goal. Cunningham would start the Vikings next postseason game, a loss to Steve Young and the 49ers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1998** – Brad Johnson starts the first two games for the Vikings in 1998, both victories, before leaving with a leg injury in Week 2. Cunningham starts the remaining 14 games for the team and goes 13-1. The Vikings finish 15-1 and set the record for points scored in a season with 541, led in part by phenomenal rookie wide receiver Randy Moss. For the first time in his coaching career, Dennis Green gets to start the same quarterback in consecutive postseason appearances, starting Cunningham in a 41-21 win over an Arizona Cardinals team that had just won its first postseason game in 51 years. Dennis Green gets his second career postseason victory and advances to his first ever NFC Championship game as head coach, where his Vikings would fall to the Falcons 30-27. Cunningham finishes the season with 3,704 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, 10 interceptions, a 106.0 passer rating, and 2nd in the MVP voting behind Terrell Davis, who had 2,008 rushing yards and 21 rushing TDs for the Broncos.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1999** – Coming off of his stellar 1998 season, Dennis Green decides to stick with the 36-year-old Cunningham as his starter. The Vikings trade Brad Johnson to the Washington Redskins for a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd round draft pick. Johnson would have his greatest statistical season in Washington that year, throwing for over 4,000 yards for the only time in his career with a 90.0 quarterback rating, leading the Redskins to a 10-6 record and a playoff victory over the Lions in the Wild Card round. The Vikings bring in veteran quarterback and malcontent Jeff George to backup Cunningham, and Green drafts a new quarterback to eventually replace Cunningham with 1st round pick Daunte Culpepper. Unfortunately for Green, Cunningham’s production falls off a cliff this season. After throwing just 8 touchdowns to 9 interceptions, Cunningham is benched after 6 games for George, who goes 8-2 in the team’s final 10 games and secures them a Wild Card spot. George becomes the 6th different quarterback to start a playoff game under Dennis Green and defeats the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card round. The next week George throws 4 touchdown passes, but is bested by Kurt Warner who throws 5 in a 49-37 win on the way to his only Super Bowl win. Cunningham would spend the next 2 seasons as a backup in Dallas and Baltimore, starting 5 more games before retiring in 2002.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2000** – Dennis Green tells Jeff George to, “shop around” before offering him a 1-year, $400,000 contract to return. George elects to sign with the Redskins and become former Vikings QB Brad Johnson’s backup, where he would take over the job from him in 2001. The Vikings bring in veteran castoffs Bubby Brister and Scott Mitchell as backups. Green decides to go all-in with 2nd year quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who did not have a single pass attempt his rookie year. Culpepper pays off Green’s decision by going 11-5 as a starter, throwing for nearly 4,000 yards and 33 TDs with a quarterback rating of 98.0. The Vikings win their 4th division title under Green and make the playoffs for the 5th consecutive year. For just the second time during his tenure with the Vikings, Dennis Green has 1 quarterback start all 16 games, and for the first time makes the playoffs with them. In his first career playoff start in the Divisional Round, Culpepper defeats a Saints team that had just won its first playoff game in franchise history before losing to the Giants 41-0 in the NFC Championship game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2001** – Culpepper is the team’s starter again but immediately goes 0-2.  He would ultimately throw just 14 touchdowns to 13 interceptions while getting sacked 33 times in the team’s first 11 games before missing the team’s final 5 games with a knee injury. With Bubby Brister and Scott Mitchell no longer on the roster, Green has to turn to undrafted, unproven 4th year quarterback Todd Bouman and the famously terrible member of the Brady 6, Spergon Wynn, to start for him. In Green’s final game as head coach of the Vikings, Wynn goes 11-30 for 114 yards, with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions in a loss to Green Bay. Green was fired before Week 17, what would be Wynn’s final appearance in the NFL before leaving for the Canadian Football League and ultimate obscurity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Green left the Vikings with a 97-63 regular season record and 4-8 playoff record, making it to the NFC Championship game in the 2000 and 1998 seasons and only missing the playoffs twice. His final quarterback count was 10 different starters in almost 10 full seasons, with 7 different starting quarterbacks for his 8 different playoff runs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Among active head coaches, 9 have made the playoffs with multiple QBs while only 4 have done it with more than 2 different QBs (Carroll, O’Brien, Reid, John Gruden). Andy Reid has taken the most different quarterbacks to the playoffs among active head coaches with 5 (McNabb, Garcia, Vick, A. Smith, Mahomes) and that was spread out over 20 seasons compared to 6 for Green. While not quite as impressive as Joe Gibbs winning 3 Super Bowls with 3 different quarterbacks, I think what Green accomplished also deserves recognition.

10,Resale ticket price advice for a visiting Brit.,"Hi all,

My wife and I will be in the US from the UK in August - September. We'll be in New York 28, 29, 30 Aug and unless I'm very confused with timezones, Jets vs Eagles is the night of the 29th.

We'd like to see an NFL game (and we're going to Philadelphia on the 30th so seems like a good game to see!) but the ticket prices are kind of confusing. On the Jets site, some of the resale tickets that *appear* to be really good seats, close to the pitch (field?) are hundred of dollars, and some about 4 rows away are about $50. I know in a UK football ground that might be because some seats are obscured by structures, pillars, whatever, but don't know if the same is true at the MetLife. Basically, why do the prices fluctuate so much even within the same block/row? I see why the prices vary between blocks based on distance from pitch and viewing angle, I don't expect all of the seats in the stadium to be the same price, I'm talking about varying prices of seats very very close to each other.

Cheers!",nfl,Saxon2060,29,2019-07-02

37,Aaron Rodgers in 2011 threw the (currently) 7th most td passes in a season by a player. The 2011 Packers on the other hand tied for the second most td passes in a season by a team. A similar situation occurs with passing yards,"With Rodgers throwing 45, he's quite a distance away from Manning (2013) with 55 TDs, and even #2 split between Brady (2007) and Mahomes (2018) at 50. However, those three were the sole scorers through the air for their teams those years. As opposed to Rodgers who gave a week 17 start to Matt Flynn, and [he scored 6 tds in one of the most fantastic games ever](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201201010gnb.htm)

With those 6 tds, 2011 turns from what would be the 7th most td passes, to the second most td passes (by a team) tying with the 2004 Colts, having Peyton throwing 49 and Sorgi throwing 2 tds without a start. 

Rodgers on the other hand didnt make that much of a splash in terms of yardage, ranking now 44th (at the time, still 18th) with 4643 yards. But Flynns game with nearly 500 yards shot the team up the leaderboard. With 5161 yards, the team makes a new place on the rankings. Using PFR, and a few other sources, GB jumps up to 12th overall in terms of a teams passing. Using NFL.com and PFR, i think i got all the seasons better than them, but apologies if i missed one

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

Today we eagerly bring you the players whose average rank placed them from 30 thru 21, with write-ups for each player from some of this year’s rankers.   
  
We say it in every post, every year, and this year it is truer than ever: these rankings are for the 2018 season, so all players are listed with their 2018 team and all performances are based on 2018 performances. 

And a reminder, don’t miss out on the Thursday posts this year, as they will contain all of the polls, the rankings for kickers and punters as well as a write up from one of our rankers each week, laying out their strategy for ranking the players in their list.

Now, with all of that out of the way, here are the seventh group of names on the 2019 r/NFL Top 100 Players (of the 2018 Season).

On paper, Todd Gurley had a phenomenal season, accounting for 21 total TDs and over 1800+ all purpose yards. All of this done on excellent efficiency with 4.9 YPC. However, for better or worse, these stats don’t tell the whole story on Gurley’s season. Due to a lingering knee issue, his play at the end of the year tailed off, and could not play in the Rams last two games. This is around the time CJ Anderson started to shine, and many people believed that Gurley’s production was a product of the players around him, specifically offensive line. 

While Gurley may not be the absolute best pure runner in the NFL, he still has the vision and the cuts to find the holes he needs both at the first and second level. [(First run vs. Denver.)](https://youtu.be/XugXFkY3vqM)
Even with his 6’1 220+ frame and a knee injury that lingered throughout the season, [he still managed to make some defenses look silly with his speed bouncing to the outside.](https://youtu.be/XugXFkY3vqM?t=128)
He used that big frame to get to 17 rushing TDs total, many of which were within 5 yards.
What really makes Gurley so valuable to the Rams though is that he is a complete back, capable of taking on all sorts of rushers in pass protection, and being a very solid and aware pass-catcher. [He does quite a bit of damage on screens](https://youtu.be/atq0Jf5EewY?t=115), and was targeted often. 
It’s because he’s the quintessential complete back that he’s ranked where he is and garners the respect he does. 

Unfortunately, this is likely the last we’ll see Gurley get over 1800 all purpose yards, as his knee arthritis condition will limit his touches and prevent him from being the every-down back he was before. That being said, he’ll still definitely stay a major offensive threat due to this versatility whenever he is on the field.

Demarcus Lawrence is a bully. He will take your mother out to a nice candlelit dinner and never call her again. He doesn't need to steal your lunch money because he already has it. He stole it from your Dad before he even gave it to you. I say all this to give you a visual representation of a man who will absolutely [fuck you up](https://twitter.com/WillBrinson/status/1081743150039949313). Look at that. I'm pretty sure Ifedi's heart just decided to stop beating after a blow like that. Or maybe he just decided it was time to hang up the cleats. How does one even come back from that?

I don't want to get bogged down in PFF stats and other cool stuff in the numbers when talking about D-Law because, truth be told, he's a highlight machine. If you are unlucky enough to play RT for a team going against the Cowboys you should already know that you won't remember the next day. But, you see, the Eagles didn't seem to understand this. They chose to *run the option* against him! [This is what happens when you try to run the option against Demarcus Lawrence](https://i.imgur.com/q5ZGdD7.gifv). 

Now, what did we learn Carson? ...Carson? Are you okay?

""....What day is it?""

Demarcus Lawrence consistently pressures the quarterback, the running back, and just about anyone you decide to put in the backfield. [He has enough nuance in his arm and hip motion to blow past massive offensive linemen](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1064658929928548354?s=19), but he almost ever uses it because [he prefers to make you look like an absolute buffoon on national television](https://twitter.com/VeteranScout/status/1044386871919357953?s=19). All in all, you gameplan for D-Law or he ruins your day. Simple as that. Very few players have the ability to find the ball as consistently as he does, and he does it while hauling a 300-pound lineman.

**Written By:** */u/wrhslax1996 * [](/PHI)  
  
I'm going to let y'all in on a little secret. Zach Ertz is a good Tight End. To start, let's get the boring statistics out of the way.

Zach Ertz finished 2019 with 154 targets, 116 catches (which set the NFL TE single-season reception record), 1163 yards (a personal best by more than 300 yards), 8 TDs, 2.04 yards per route run, and he looked much improved as a blocker. He accounted for 26% of all Eagles targets on the year, 27.5% of all Eagles receptions, and 27.6% of the Eagles receiving TDs. He was obscenely good last season statistically and was, in my opinion, one of the best receivers in the NFL last season. Watching every game, it was almost like every time the ball went to him I expected a first down which is not a feeling most teams have the luxury of knowing.

A common narrative I've seen on r/nfl and on various talkshows is that Wentz spent the whole season checking the ball down to Ertz. After all, how do you get that many receptions in a season? Well, I'll show you why he was (and should have been) Wentz's favorite target.

First, Ertz is [phenomenal at the catch point](https://twitter.com/BR_NFL/status/1056576666254884864). This play is obscenely good, in my opinion. The coverage isn't bad on a good route, but Ertz goes up and attacks the ball and does not allow himself to be outmuscled by a defender in good position to make a play on the ball. This aggression at the point of the catch is something Eagles fans are all well aware of and you'll see that in a lot of the following clips. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp_Pf2MWAG8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33) is linked to take you to a similar catch by Ertz against the Vikings last season. I recommend watching the whole video, but at least watch the route/catch at 0:33. It is extremely difficult to defend Ertz when the ball is in the air because he's that good at putting himself in a good, strong position to make the catch.

Second, his [route running](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/1046873465213607937) [is](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/1067193455196233728) [so](https://twitter.com/TSteegeNFL/status/1050840516533743617) [good](https://twitter.com/MattBowen41/status/1071812991803383809). The first clip posted by Fran Duffy exhibits how good Ertz is at finding the soft spot in a zone, settling in, and getting an easy 10-20 yards. Ertz won't wow anybody with his open-field speed, but he has the football IQ and awareness to exploit the soft spots in a zone defense and capitalize. The second clip posted by Duffy is also impressive. The giants send a man across the field following Golden Tate to bluff man-coverage. After the ball is snapped, however, the Giants immediately go to a Cover 2 Zone defense. Great job by Wentz on the read, but Ertz runs a great route, finds the hole, catches the ball, and fights his way through four defenders into the end zone. The 3rd clip above (posted by Tyler Steege) displays Ertz's pure route running ability. He's matched up with CB Janoris Jenkins and Ertz manages to completely turn him around en route to catching a TD pass from Carson Wentz. What Ertz lacks in speed he more than makes up for in his ability to sell great routes and get defenses turned around. The fourth clip above, posted by Matt Bowen, is just more of the same impressive route-running. Ertz uses his body to bait DBs into getting out of position, thus getting him more separation and allowing for an easier catch. Ertz's route-running and football acumen make him a bona fide mismatch for any defense.

Third, I'd like to provide two more clips. [This one](https://twitter.com/J_Sammour/status/1082299935863779328) exhibits that Ertz is not a completely helpless blocker. I won't claim he's on the level of Kittle as a blocker because that would just not be true, but when he puts in good effort, Ertz can block. He was much improved as a blocker last season. [This clip](https://twitter.com/BR_NFL/status/1076940552787111937) should hopefully put to rest the ZaCh ErTz CaNt GeT YaC crowd. I won't claim he's elite after the catch, but he can bump and grind his way down to the end zone when he needs to/has the space. God I love Zach Ertz.

Also, I feel like I can't really capture the entire story of his 2018 season without providing [this clip](https://twitter.com/247KevinBoilard/status/1054061464724627458) of Ertz getting laid out by Eric Reid. I learned two things from this clip. 1) Ertz loves his QB and will defend Wentz's honor to the grave. 2) Ertz should probably stick to catching the football instead of getting into fights on the field.

I hope this was informative. I love talking about Zach Ertz and I hope you learned something about his 2019. He was really good and earned a high position on this years top 100.

The Jaguars have had a lot of free agent signings over the past decade that didn’t go to plan. Julius Thomas, Aaron Ross, Laurent Robinson… there have been a lot of free agents that went off script. But Calais Campbell is not one of them. In fact, he is making a case for the greatest defensive free agent signing in franchise history after just two seasons.

Campbell followed up an incredible 2017 season, where he was a First Team All Pro and a Pro Bowler, by picking up right where he left off. He started all 16 games for the Jaguars, recorded 10.5 sacks, a career-high 72 tackles, and 20 tackles for a loss, which was the third best total in the league last year. Consider this:

- Campbell is the only Jaguar ever to have back-to-back seasons of 10+ sacks; he had 14.5 sacks in 2017, and 10.5 sacks in 2018.

- Campbell’s 20 tackles for a loss set the franchise record for most TFLs in a single season. In fact, it completely destroyed the record; the previous record, held by Sen’Derrick Marks in 2014 and Gary Walker in 2001, was 15. Campbell eclipsed that mark by 33%.

- Over the final month of the season, Campbell recorded 4.5 sacks, had eight tackles for a loss, and recorded 10 quarterback hits.

Campbell has been one of the best defensive line players in the NFL for quite some time now, and the 2018 season was no exception.

Going into the 2018 off-season, numerous writers and analysts throughout the football universe had pegged the Indianapolis Colts as one of the top (bottom?) candidates in terms of lack of top-flite talent, particularly on the defensive end. The secondary was a mish-mash of undrafted overachievers and unproven talent, while the front seven had no star power of which to speak.

Enter Darius Leonard. 

Initially labeled as [one of the worst picks of the draft] (https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2773118-nfl-draft-2018-results-reviewing-this-years-worst-picks.amp.html), Leonard went from camp sensation to exploding onto the scene with 19 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble, AND a pass defended [in his second career game](https://youtu.be/Qej3TmbDoH4). ""The Maniac"" would rampage though his rookie season, leading the entire league in tackles with 163, finishing second among rookies with 7 sacks, while chipping in 4 forced fumbles, 2 interceptions, and 8 passes defended. For his efforts, he was named a first-team All-Pro and Defensive Rookie of the Year.

Leonard gained a knack for making huge plays in the clutch, such as his [game-sealing forced fumble](https://youtu.be/5SKH2K-Df_k) against Oakland, or his [excellent coverage to force a last-minute interception](https://www.colts.com/video/malik-hooker-picks-off-eli-to-seal-colts-comeback-win) against the Giants. Despite questions about his coverage skills, Leonard showed constant improvement throughout the year, using his speed to come up with clutch deflections, even when he was tasked with lining up against players like DeAndre Hopkins one-on-one in the red zone.

Colts fans could not be more excited about the future for Leonard. He is already the best defensive player Indianapolis has had since at least Robert Mathis. It will be tough to clear the bar Leonard set as a rookie, but his work ethic and versatile skill set will help him improved throughout his career.

But it's also worth noting just how [pinpoint accurate](https://streamable.com/b76w8) Russell Wilson can be, completing 5.2% more passes than expected (according to [Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/passing#completionPercentageAboveExpectation)) and [it shows](https://streamable.com/7aeci). He is rarely found in the conversation with the NFL's most accurate quarterbacks but there aren't many other quarterbacks that can consistently hit receivers that are [consistently not open](https://streamable.com/n73ob). But I know what you're thinking. You don't want to see any of these throws. You want to see THE throw.

You don't want to see the [game winners](https://streamable.com/s8p3v) against [Carolina](https://streamable.com/7affd), you don't want to see the [deep balls in Dallas](https://streamable.com/pveth).

What do you think of when you think of a superstar receiver? Probably a physical freak of nature that has the size and the speed. Most of the time, you’re right, but there are exceptions to every rule. Tyreek Hill is one of them. He beats you in different ways and he still just as good as those other elites at producing for his team. In some ways, he’s even better. Let’s find out how. 

First, let’s go ahead and break this stereotype up right now. He can make those contested catches too. Just as good as those other elites. [In fact, he’s even better](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-ranking-the-nfls-top-receivers-in-contested-catch-situations). If you need to see it in action, [just ask the 49ers](https://imgur.com/a/aXGlKKo). 

Many of you probably value yards per route run when judging a wide receiver. It’s a top efficiency metric available for us to easily see. Hill’s is 2.54. This is behind only Julio Jones and Michael Thomas among qualifying wide receivers. 3rd behind those two isn’t too shabby.

Now to the volume statistic correspondent there. Total receiving yards. 1,479 is his total here. This ranks him 4th in the NFL. This is behind Jones, Hopkins, and Evans, whose totals are 1,677, 1,572, and 1,524 respectively. Pretty solid right? Well, it’s about to get a little more impressive. Going through the situational statistics on NFL’s website and calculating the number of yards each receiver accumulated in which their team was losing by 17 or more is how. Julio’s was 222, Hopkins was at 46, and Evans came in at 135. What was Hill at? 0. If you were to take these off their totals, Hill will obviously stay at 1,479. Julio drops to 1,455, Hopkins drops to 1,526, and Evans down to 1,389. With Hill not losing any yardage here off his total, he’s now second in the NFL, behind Hopkins. It’s not fair to take those yards away from them by any means. They still made the plays and there were no doubt times there where the game was still in reach. It’s still a great way to add a little context to their numbers, and you can make of those what you wish.

Let’s move onto his bread and butter. Deep yards. In case you weren’t sure what this statistic actually is, it means that the pass traveled 20 yards past the line of scrimmage before being caught by the WR. You are probably expecting Hill to be good here. And you’re right. He is. No wait. You’re wrong. He was great. Outstanding. By far the best in the NFL. His yards accumulated here ranked him 1st in the NFL, and not just by a little bit. Hill had 754 deep yards in 2018. Second place was Evans with 543. I’ll do the math for you. That’s 211 yards ahead of 2nd place in the NFL. To add a little context to that, if we go through the 2nd-10th place guys, the biggest gap from one position to the next is 75 yards, and that’s the gap from 6th place Julio at 464 and 7th place Adams at 389. The next biggest is 34 yards, the distance between Lockett in 4th, coming in at 520, and Antonio Brown in 5th at 486. That’s an insane amount of distance he’s ahead of 2nd place when we look at how much everyone else is bunched up. I don’t need to tell you the significance of this statistic. Everyone here knows how much that opens up the field for other guys like Kelce and how it massively helps the screen game that Reid loves to run.

Now I know what you’re thinking. He had the top QB of 2018 throwing him the ball in Mahomes. Fair point. Well, to that I say, in 2017 with Smith at the helm, he had a QB rating when targeted of 130.5 and 628 deep yards, and those were both tops in the league. Those 628 deep yards would also place him 2nd in 2018, behind only himself. Granted Smith was a top five QB of 2017, but he was also someone who, until 2017, was thought of as someone who doesn’t throw deep a ton. And Smith last season I’d certainly argue was not a ton better passing the ball than many of the other QBs that WRs here on this list in 2018 I’m comparing Hill to with these statistics had. 2017 obviously doesn’t factor into our rankings, but it does provide the context needed for that specific argument, which is an inevitable one.

How about YAC? Yeah, you guessed it, he’s pretty awesome here too. 524 was his 2018 total, good for 2nd in the NFL among WRs. The Chargers in week 1 found out about this very early on. [Here we see him blow by the edge guy and get 10 yards down field before the defense even knows what hit em](https://imgur.com/a/UlGrk4a). And if that wasn’t enough for them, [he took one to the house later on in the game](https://imgur.com/a/piHiacw). Then there were just the little things he did all season that were imperative to the team. Against a top edge guy in T.J. Watt, [he avoids him and turns a 5 yard loss into a 5 yard gain](https://imgur.com/a/UNTAxyH). The difference between 2nd and 5 and 2nd and 15 is massive. Watt did everything perfect here and makes that play against possibly every player in the league except Hill.

Just to touch on a few intangibles, he was first in the NFL among WRs in all purpose yards. Special teams contributions did not factor into our rankings, but it does once again provide a little context. Had he not done the punt return stuff (which he was amazing at), then it’s fair to say he’d have accumulated a few more offensive yards. Rushing yards? 151 of those, good for 2nd among traditional wide receivers. That was something implemented periodically in the Chiefs offense, and it [often worked to perfection](https://imgur.com/a/EqyASRf).

It’s clear. He’s elite. He’s one of the very best in the NFL at the wide receiver position. He’s THE best at the deep game and, per PFF, was the best in 2018 in contested catches as well. He’s not a gadget player. He’s not a secret weapon. Hill is imperative to the success of the Chiefs offense. I would say he’s not a guy you play tight man to man coverage on with no safety help, [but the Raiders decided to try to anyway](https://imgur.com/a/mOUCt2v). For his tremendous efforts, consistency, and elite play at the wide receiver position, Hill lands at spot number 24 on our list.

Patrick Peterson proved again why he is considered the model for prospective NFL shutdown corners. His athletic prowess and undeniably effective man coverage technique and talent was on full display in 2018. Despite the Cardinals turn for the worse, Peterson without question took his game to another level.

Although unaccustomed to such a large percentage of his snaps being zone coverage, Peterson took to them quickly and added a new wrinkle for quarterbacks to deal with when targeting him. He was quick to identify routes, jumped them without leaving his responsibilities and for the most part shutdown whatever side of the field he was on.

Peterson’s man coverage capabilities were given more exposure down the stretch as Wilks shifted his defensive philosophy back towards more of what it was under James Bettcher and Todd Bowles. We saw Peterson play more press man coverage and receiver targets in his vicinity took a dramatic drop.

Overall Peterson’s coverage netted him one of the lowest target percentages on coverage snaps. Only 9% of all quarterback throws went his way, he gave up an extremely low .63 yards per coverage snap, and he only allowed 30 receptions for 364 yards on 52 targets. Peterson locked down his side of the field with authority.

Although this upcoming year Peterson will be sitting out for the first 6 games of the season due to a PED suspension we should expect the 8 time Pro Bowler and 4 time 1st Team All-Pro corner to return to form immediately.

Christian McCaffrey did just about everything for the Panthers this year, playing one of the most versatile roles in the entire league. From breaking an NFL record, 107 catches at the RB position to averaging 5.0 yards per carry, it's no shock to see him at 2nd team All Pro despite the extremely tough competition at running back. McCaffrey was on the field for over 90% of snaps, easily the most at his position, and filled up the box score with 1900+ all purpose yards.  
  
Dealing with some unfortunate injury luck with both starting tackles (Matt Kalil and Daryl Williams) missing the entire season, McCaffrey, along with Norv Turner, exceeded well beyond expectations. Often times the entire defense would zero in on McCaffrey [opening plays up for others players such as CJ Anderson](https://streamable.com/3qpam). Everyone looks out for the potential McCaffrey screen and it results in an easy TD for CJ. There was no shortage of highlight plays either with [this hurdle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raq4Od7-n48) making it's way on to a few television screens along with his 63 broken tackles, second to only Saquon Barkley in that measure. In short, with Cam Newton's arm giving out mid season, our offense essentially evolved around our RB and he delivered every week, easily deserving of a top 25 spot

David Bakhtiari has been the best pass-blocking left tackle since Joe Thomas retired.

Now, I know whenever you put any tackle's name in the same sentence as a legendary figure like Thomas, you immediately lose some credibility, so let me explain.

It all starts with the stance; Bakhtiari has [that classic James Campen-taught stance](https://imgur.com/arWhyWZ.png) with the droopy back leg and the right arm keeping him hunched over his knee. There's really nothing like it elsewhere in the NFL--the other other guy who kept his leg so far back and his body so hunched over was [Thomas](http://cdn.insidethepylon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/joe-thomas-still-1-218x300.png).

Again, whenever you start drawing comparisons to the greatest of all time, things get a little murky. If there was ever something to criticize about Joe, it was his stance. It's supposed to hurt your balance, mobility, and power. It limits your ability to react to a pass rusher. If any other tackle in the league tried to copy Joe Thomas' stance, they would fail. Only Joe can use his stance, because he is the exception to every rule.

Bakhtiari has become the exception.

Now, his standalone pass-block stats tell the story of just a good tackle, not the dominant force he truly is--he ranks 6th in hurries allowed, 7th in QB hits allowed, 12th in sacks allowed (all per pass block snap), and his pass-blocking efficiency of 97.9 is just 7th among tackles. However, it's the way he allowed pressures that made him a first-team All-Pro for the first time. 

From PFF:

&gt; Another thing that makes him so special is his how infrequently he loses cleanly. We separate our downgrades for offensive linemen in pass protection into three buckets based on how quickly and cleanly they lose. Bakhtiari was one of six starting tackles this season to not have a single pass blocking rep that earned the worst downgrade – and he did it on the third-most pass-blocking snaps of any tackle in the NFL (737). Among full-time starters this season, Bakhtiari had the fourth-fewest amount of pass-blocking snaps that earned the second-lowest downgrade as well (10). His consistency and relatively mild losses are a big reason why Aaron Rodgers is capable of making so many second reaction plays whether it’s inside or outside the pocket.

Considering Rodgers' average time to throw last season was 2.95 seconds, good for 5th highest in the league, and he held on to the ball for over 3 seconds on 30% of his dropbacks, the fact that Bakhtiari can maintain such a high level of production is absurd--but that's just the price of being the protective brother your quarterback never had.

86,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 36)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 36: 1955 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 24-December 11, 1955

Teams: 12

1955 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1955 First Draft Pick: George Shaw, Running Back from the University of Oregon (Baltimore Colts)

1955 NFL Championship Game: Cleveland Browns (9-2-1) defeated Los Angeles Rams (8-3-1)  38-14 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The ball is dead immediately when the ball carrier touches the ground with any part of his body except his hands or feet while in the grasp of an opponent.

\-A new exception is made in regard to scoring a safety: When a defender intercepts a pass, his intercepting momentum carries him into his own end zone, and he is stopped before returning the ball back into the field of play, then the ball will be next put in play at the spot of the interception.

The NFL, after using the DuMont Television Network for the airing of games, was offered $100,000 from NBC to allow them to broadcast the NFL Championship Game at the conclusion of the season, this being the first big move in the league being nationally televised throughout the season.

The defending champion Browns dropped their opener, at home, to the Redskins 27–17, but a 6-game win streak put them back in front to win the Eastern race. The Western race was crowded a few times, as the Rams had to share the lead. In Week 8, the Bears beat Los Angeles 24–3, to give both teams 5–3 records, The next week (November 20), the Bears took the lead with a 24–14 at Detroit while the Rams got a 17–17 tie at Baltimore. As had happened many times before in the annual battle of Chicago, the Bears were upset by the Cardinals in Week 10 (November 27), 53–14; the Rams eked out a 23–21 in Philadelphia on Les Richter's field goal with 0:07 left in the game. In Week 11 (December 4), the Rams won 20–14 over Baltimore, and the Bears kept their hopes alive with a difficult 21–20 win over Detroit. In the latter game, the Lions' Doak Walker missed an extra point, lost a fumble late in the game on the Detroit 28, and was wide on a 35-yard field goal attempt in the final seconds. The Bears won their last game (December 11), 17–10 over Philadelphia, to finish 8–4, and hoped the 7–3–1 Rams would lose their game in Los Angeles against Green Bay. The Rams did not lose, clinching a spot in the title game, with a 31–17 win.

The 1955 NFL Championship Game once again featured the Cleveland Browns, taking on the Los Angeles Rams. This was a rematch from the 1950 and 1951 NFL Championship Games, which the teams split 1-1. The game took place in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The attendance of 87,695 broke the NFL championship game record by nearly 30,000. This was the first NFL championship game played on a Monday and the first televised by NBC. In their 6th consecutive NFL title game, the Browns were 6-point favorites.

As the game started, Browns veteran Lou Groza kicked off; Rams rookie halfback Ron Waller returned the kick, and Groza himself made the tackle. A subsequent Rams drive was stopped at the Cleveland 12 when Kenny Konz intercepted a Norm Van Brocklin pass.

Browns quarterback Otto Graham, who had announced his retirement at the end of the season, drove Cleveland to the L.A. 26 where Groza's FG gave the Browns a 3–0 first quarter lead. The Browns scored again when DB Don Paul intercepted Van Brocklin's pass on the Browns 35 and raced 65 yards for a touchdown, making the score 10–0.

The Rams answered back when Van Brocklin connected with halfback Volney ""Skeet"" Quinlan for a 67-yard touchdown, pulling the Rams to within 3 points, 10–7, and giving the large crowd hopes of an upset. But late in the second period, Van Brocklin threw his third interception of the half; defensive back Tom James, who had been beaten on the Rams' Tom Fears' title-winning touchdown on the same field 4 years earlier, grabbed the errant pass and took the ball back to midfield with time running out. The next play turned a close game into a rout; Otto Graham found Dante Lavelli with a 50-yard touchdown pass along the sideline and the Rams, who moments earlier were driving to take the lead, went to the locker room down 17–7.

With a 10-point lead coming out of the locker room, Graham earned his place as the star of the game. After moving the Browns from the L.A. 46, Graham kept the ball and ran around right end from the 19 and scored to put the Browns ahead 24–7. On Los Angeles's next possession, Sam Palumbo intercepted Van Brocklin at the Ram 36. Graham drove the Browns to the 4, then scored himself on a sneak. Groza's conversion increased Cleveland's lead to 31–7 with two minutes left in the third quarter.

In the final period, Graham tossed a 35-yard touchdown pass to Ray Renfro and Groza's kick gave the Browns a 38–7 lead. Late in the game, Waller ran four yards for a touchdown and Les Richter's conversion finished the scoring. In the final minutes coach Brown sent in reserve quarterback George Ratterman and allowed Graham to leave the field to an ovation from the Los Angeles crowd.

Cleveland, with its 3rd title of the decade, represented the American/Eastern Conference in the championship game every year since its admission to the NFL, celebrated Graham's farewell. The Rams' Van Brocklin, who threw 6 interceptions, often was quoted that it was the worst game of his Hall of Fame career.

The Browns would not win another title until the 1964 season, that also stands as their most recent NFL Championship. The Rams wouldn't appear in another title game until 1980 in Super Bowl XIV.

90,The Most Impressive Feat: The Perfect Game vs. The Impossible Comeback,"*The two examples I will use come from arguably the 2 greatest quarterbacks of all time and are actually very symbolic of their careers. Peyton Manning’s perfect 158.3 passer rating vs. the Broncos in the 2003 playoffs. And Tom Brady orchestrating arguably the greatest comeback in NFL history against the Falcons in Super Bowl 51.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Manning vs. Broncos: 2003 WC Round**

By halftime the Colts were up 31-3. They started the game with four straight touchdowns and ended the half with a fifth consecutive scoring drive (field goal). After the half, the Colts came out with yet another touchdown making it six straight scoring drives to start the game. After this drive, which put the Colts up 38-3, Manning was done with 5:24 left in the 3rd quarter. He only attempted 1 more pass for the rest of the game (6 yard completion to Marvin Harrison). In fact the Colts didn’t punt the ball at all during the game.  Had the Colts kept their foot on the gas the entire game, they were on pace for 58 points over a 60 minute game.

Peyton Manning was 22/26 for 377 yards and 5 TD and of course a perfect 158.3 passer rating. He had more touchdowns than incompletions which in itself is incredibly rare. Only three times in NFL history has a quarterback held a perfect passer rating in the playoffs and Manning is the only one since 1976 to do it. His Y/A was 14.5 which is the 6th highest ever in a playoff game during the Super Bowl era. His 18.35 ANY/Y+ is the highest ever in a playoff game during the Super Bowl Era (Fun Fact: Tebow vs. Steelers is the 2nd highest ANY/A+ at 16.95).  His TD% is the 5th highest of any quarterback in a game (19.2%) in the Super Bowl Era. This means he threw a TD basically once every 5 pass ATTEMPTS.

As stated previously, Peyton was finished with 5:24 left in the 3rd quarter. Had he kept his pace over a full 60 minutes he would have been 33/39 for 571 yards and 7.6 touchdowns.

Another thing to mention is the Broncos defense. While not elite, they were still very solid. 6th in passing yards allowed, 4th in total yards allowed, 9th in points allowed, and 12th by defensive DVOA. They only allowed 30+ points twice in the regular season: to HOF quarterbacks Tom Brady and Brett Favre. The Patriots and Packers scored 30 and 31 points respectively against the Broncos. Manning’s Colts accomplished that feat in the 1st half alone.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Brady vs. Falcons: Super Bowl 51**

With 8:31 left in the 3rd quarter the Falcons were up 28-3. A couple minutes later, the Falcons win probability peaked at 99.8%. Up to Super Bowl 51, teams were 4-1057 since 1991 when trailing by 25 points or more.  However, the Patriots were not just trailing by 25, they were trailing by 25 with less than a 3rd of the game to play. Up to that game and since 2001, teams down between 26 and 23 points with 6-9 min left in the 3Q were 0-190. If the Patriots were to win the most important game of the year, they would have had to be literally flawless from then on out.

After the Falcons went up 28-3, the Patriots scored on five consecutive drives converting 22/23 first downs and scoring four touchdowns and a field goal (The one first down in which they didn’t convert led to the field goal). During these five drives, Brady was 4/6 on 3rd down including 3/3 from 3rd and 8 or longer. On the two 3rd downs he didn’t convert, he converted one 4th down and the other was kicked for a field goal. If the Patriots didn’t convert anything less than a single 1st down (less than 22/23) they would have lost the game. From 8:31 to the end of the game, the Patriots were scoring at an insane pace. If the Patriots kept that pace over a 60-minute game, they would have scored 74 points.

For the entire game, Brady was 43/62 for 466 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT, and a 95.2 passer rating. However, the majority of those stats came during the comeback. From 8:31 left in the 3rd quarter to the end of the game, Tom Brady was 27/34 for 284 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT with a 122.7 Passer Rating. If this rate were to be applied over a full 60-minute game, Brady would have been 59/74 throwing for 620 yards and 4.4 touchdowns.

Last thing of note were Brady’s targets during the comeback: Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan, Danny Amendola, Malcolm Mitchell, Dion Lewis, Martellus Bennett, and James White. That’s two undrafted WR, a 7th round QB, a 5th round RB, a 4th round WR, a 4th round RB, and a 2nd round TE at the tail end of his career. Those seven players have combined for 0 Pro Bowls and 0 All Pro.

112,[OC] Which Teams are the best overperformers/underperformers in the NFL?,"Okay, so if you believe Pythagorean Win Expectation is an accurate regression tool to shape where teams will tend to move over the course of a season, we can look at end results to determine which teams outperformed their PWE and which teams didn't. So I decided to test the theory and call it TVA (team value added).

Now, a few things about what I did:

1. I looked at the 2017 and 2018 season so that I had more data to go off of than just a single year. It was a lot just to do these two seasons, but obviously with more data, the more meaningful an insight could become (or be invalidated).
2. I wanted to see if there was a ""value added"" statistic that could possibly be assigned to coaching or some other intangible contribution to team results. In other words, can we quantify the added wins to teams on a consistent basis? So with that in mind, I did not include teams that changed coaches in 2017 or 2018 with the exception of the Chargers, who changed coaches after 1 game, since coaching would likely be the first factor that comes up as an ""intangible contribution"" that adds wins (or losses). That is why there are 5 or 6 teams not included here.

Using the formula found here:

[https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2017/presenting-adjusted-pythagorean-theorem](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2017/presenting-adjusted-pythagorean-theorem)

I found the Pythagorean expected wins for each team who had a single head coach for the full 2 seasons - again, with the exception of the Chargers.

I compared actual wins to Pythagoren wins. With that difference, I normalized the results. Thus, higher results imply that a team outperforms its Pythagorean wins. Lower results imply the team underperformed. Perhaps this can be attributed to coaching? Or single season luck? What do you think?

I then normalized each annual result with 0 representing the average team, in other words, the team that neither overhwelmed or underwhelmed, just the team that whelmed.

And I averaged both the normalized 2017 and 2018 results for an average of the past 2 seasons.

The following table is an ordered list of the teams the most outperformed their Pythagorean expectations vs the teams who did not.

https://i.redd.it/atylvvbqry731.png

As you can see, teams like the Ravens, Jaguars, and Bucs routinely underperformed according to PWE, and Miami, Buffalo, and Dallas overperformed.

What does this mean?

1. Some may argue that this implies the coaching staff got ""more"" out of their teams like in Buffalo than they did in Jacksonville. Or maybe the players are more ""clutch"" in close games. Or perhaps the team gave up more points in garbage time and the PWE is skewed. But again, this is over 32 games, which is a significant sample, therefore the argument could be made that Sean McDermott, for instance, is bringing a lot out of his players.
2. Others may argue that Buffalo and Miami will be due for a regression assuming the roster stays largely the same, while the same can hold true for Baltimore and the others, but in the positive direction.

The true conclusion would be to look at this over a slightly longer period of time (2 years is substantial but not quite enough to glean anything truly meaningful) to see if it's possible to routinely outperform your PWE. Over time, garbage time points allowed and scored would likely even out for all teams, ""clutch"" would likely even out, and you'd be left with just what the coaches contribute.

Anyway, enjoy!",nfl,elsieandchris,18,2019-07-02

The only other current OC or HC to coach 3 different franchises to a top 10 finish in points* are Kyle Shanahan ('09 Texans, '12 Redskins, and '16 Falcons) and Ken Whisenhunt ('05 Steelers, '07/'08 Cardinals, and '16/'18 Chargers)

Both Turner and Shanahan have an opportunity next year to coach their 4th different franchise to a top 10 finish in points scored.

*as either a HC or OC. I'm not counting the assistant TEs coach as orchestrating a top 10 offense. IMO the HC and OC are the primary coaches that get to take credit (or blame) for how their offense preforms.",nfl,sip-em_bears,19,2019-07-02
115,Teams with best chance to go from worst to first in division,"8. Jets
Just by being in the same division as the Patriots, the Jets have the the hardest shot. Not even the second place Dolphins have that much higher of a shot to go to first. I do see the Jets on the rise. Bell should definitely help elevate the team. 

7. Giants
The Giants are in full rebuild mode. 4th in division next season and probably a top 5 draft pick. Sorry Giants fans.

6. Buccaneers
I don’t see the bucs getting to first with the Saints and Falcons in that division. I also need to see more form Jameis to consider that he can lead a team to a championship. 

5. Cardinals
Maybe Kyler Murray is the ultimate answer here. I don’t think we’ll find out this season but I think he will prove to be at least a decent QB for the foreseeable future. 

4. Raiders
As a Raiders fan, I believe we will be better but maybe that’s the bias. Either way the Chiefs and Chargers would have to lose a lot of power this year for the Raiders to get first. And the Raiders have to gain a lot of momentum which can happen with our revamped roster, but I still see us behind the Chiefs and/or Chargers. 

3. Lions
Maybe the team does better this year under Patricia. The North might possibly be the most competitive division this year. If everything goes well, they can end up in the wildcard, but with the Bears defense existing, and Aaron Rodgers in the division, it’s going to be hard to get first.

2. Bengals
A new head coach finally. That is the major victory for the Bengals of this 2010s decade. Maybe this new coach can lead them to the promise land, but I don’t think so at least for this year.

1. Jaguars
One game away from the SB not too long ago. I think people forget that sometimes. Nick Foles has won a ring and has proven he can lead a team through the playoffs. If he can take them to the playoffs, this Jacksonville squad can be deadly. They will surprise people this season.",nfl,will4xx,11,2019-07-02
116,How common do you guys think PED's are in the NFL?,"I used to be one of the guys that thought all nfl players were natural except for the few that got caught, but now I believe a very large amount of the nfl is on steroids and recovery drugs.

Nfl players all talk about opiates in the NFL being handed out like candy, I wouldn't be surprised if they're turning a blind eye to steroids too.

119,Let's go back to 2006. The Chargers are 14-2..,"They entered the playoffs on a 10 game winning streak, with both of their early losses coming by a combined 6 points. They had the young Philip Rivers coming off a very solid year, HOF RB LaDanian Tomlinson, future HOF TE Antonio Gates, multiple 1st Team All-Pro FB Lorenzo Neal, the NFL's sack leader Shawne Merriman, Pro Bowler Jamal Williams at DT, and multiple other studs including rookie Antonio Cromartie at CB... the leagues #1 ranked offense and #7 ranked defense.

By all accounts they were the favorites to win it all. They even seemed to be getting the best of the Patriots in their playoff game, but just made a few crucial errors and wound up losing by 3 points, prompting the infamous L.T. confrontation of the Pat's players doing the lights out dance and L.T. going on to call the team and their coach classes in post-game interviews.

BUT... if the Chargers had won that game and gone on to make it to the SB to face the Rex Grossman lead Bears, there's a really good chance they would have won that game. Which would have meant that the 2004 Draft's 1st round QBs would have all gone on to win SBs for the following three years.

2005: Big Ben
2006: Rivers
2007: Eli

I know there is no guarantee the Chargers would have won it all had they beat New England that day, and I know that going back and changing the outcomes of previous seasons could have an affect on following seasons, but how wild would that have been? For all 3 first round QBs of the 2004 draft to go on to win the following three SBs? Also Rivers might be a very solid HOF candidate if he had a ring to go along with his numbers and longevity.

123,Anyone notice / have an explanation for why top tier pass rushers (aside from 2015 Von Miller) get neutralized in the playoffs?,"Von Miller won a SB by himself dominating the Pats + Panthers, but anyone else notice how elite pass rushers generally are neutralized in the playoffs? 

Explanations I could think of include better o lines in the playoffs, teams using double teams to scheme them out of games, getting rid of the ball quicker, or pass rushers generally being worn down by the end of the season.

Just looking at this past years playoffs is illustrative:

Mack - neutralized by Eagles tackles including many 1 on 1’s 

Donald - neutralized by the Pats interior in the super bowl including many 1 on 1’s

Cox - neutralized by Bears o line

Jordan - Rams + Eagles o lines neutralized him 

Lawrence - shut down by Rams tackles

JJ watt - didn’t impact the colts game much; many 1 on 1’s

Ingram + Bosa - shut down by Pats o line

134,[OC] A Look At Every Team's 2014 Draft Class After Five Seasons,"This post is sort of a sequel to the one I posted about [the 2018 draft a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b54707/oc_a_look_at_the_early_returns_of_every_teams/), in which I ranked every team's 2018 draft class by their collective AV (Approximate Value) after their rookie seasons. People seemed to really like the post, but a common criticism (and something I also started thinking in the midst of putting together the post) was that that the sample size just isn't big enough to properly rank those classes using this methodology just yet. So instead, I'm going to rank every team's 2014 draft class with it. I chose this class in particular because it's the latest season in which all 256 draftees are officially off their rookie contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

Some quick notes on my process and how I did things:

* I recorded every player's AV for every season they were with the team that drafted them and only those seasons. For example, I did not give the Saints any credit for anything Brandin Cooks did as a member of the Patriots or Rams.
* If a player was traded or cut by the team that drafted them and contributed on a different team later in the season, I only recorded the AV they earned on the team they were drafted by. For example, the Panthers traded Kelvin Benjamin in the middle of the 2017 season, so I only gave the Panthers the AV Benjamin earned as a member of the Panthers that season.
* If a player returned to the team they were drafted by after spending time on a different team, I decided to include the AV they culminated in their second stint with their original team (Jordan Matthews), as that's not really much different from 2nd-7th round picks who were playing on their second contract with their original team in their fifth season (Derek Carr).
* I included 0 un-drafted players because I have no intention of opening up that can of worms.
* I also did not include any players who were already in the NFL that a team may have acquired by trading 2014 draft picks for for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here are the results:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|*Rank*|*Team*|*Total AV*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Jacksonville Jaguars|174|
|2|Oakland Raiders|167|
|3|St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams|142|
|4|Dallas Cowboys|119|

|32|New York Jets|3.167|

&amp;#x200B;

On my 2018 post, some suggested that I try and come up with a way to quantify how worthwhile a draftee was based on *where* they were picked in the draft, and how well a team drafted as a whole based on the value of their draft picks. To do this, I came up with the super crazy formula of **AV (Approximate Value) - EV (Expected Value) = NV (Net Value).** To quantify expected value, I just took the pick values from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/ay4m0z/7_round_mock_template_free_to_all_that_wish_to/) mock draft template and simply divided them by 40. Why divide by 40 you may ask? I simply just thought that when I divided by 40, it looked/scaled most closely to regular AV (I'm sure there is a much better way to do this and I'm totally open to hearing any suggestions in the comments). This is what the EV of the top 10 picks came out to be when I did this:

&amp;#x200B;

|*Pick*|*Expected Value*|
|:-|:-|
|1|75|
|2|65|
|3|55|
|4|45|
|5|42.5|
|6|40|
|7|37.5|
|8|35|
|9|33.75|
|10|33.5|

...and so on. You can find the entire chart with the EV of all 256 picks in the spreadsheet I linked in the bottom of the post.

I should clarify, I personally look at EV as the expected value a player will provide over the entirety of their career, not just the first five years. This is why the #1 overall pick's EV is at a ridiculously high 75 for instance, and why the Texans rank much lower when adding this extra layer in spite of drafting a great player at #1 in Jadeveon Clowney- it takes more than just five really good seasons to return value as a #1 overall pick. The Rams also take a dive here due to #2 pick Greg Robinson busting, in spite of Aaron Donald doing his best to cancel him out.

So here are the results, along with each teams best value pick:

&amp;#x200B;

|*Rank*|*Team*|*Net Value*|*Best Value*|

141,What happens when the entire NFL goes 8-,"Today, as I sifted through the endless geopolitical ramifications of the sugar trade at work, a barrage of questions ran through my head. Should I make a change in my life? Should I start exercising more and catch up on things I need to do at home? Is this what it feels like to be a responsible adult? What happens when the entire NFL finds itself completely tied? Like completely tied, like motherfucker triple-double knotted a shoe tied? Like Cincinnati Royals 1962-63 Dan **Tie**man tied?  

&amp;#x200B;

We're talking about every team having the same record, points, touchdowns, yards, SoS, interceptions and domestic violence incidents. Well I wanted to know and I figured other people did too, so let me tell y'all what a quick 5 minute google search told me.

&amp;#x200B;

First lets set some parameters. Now y'all might be thinking that every team would go 0-0-16 in a league of full parity, however, y'all motherfuckers would be wrong. **8-8 is the one true record**. That's right I said it. 

1. First of all 8 wins and 8 losses is a tie
2. A tie counts as half a win and half a loss so an 0-0-16 is the same record anyway according to the big man upstairs
3. I don't give a shit

So now that that's settled, the second parameter is that the Texans win the Superbowl in this scenario because I am heavily biased.  Oh and the Colts finish last in the division and maybe the Patriots too because I don't like losing to them every year (seriously we've only won a game against them in our existence as a franchise)

That's it.

So let's zoom into the final game of the season. Here the Raiders and Broncos fight in what will be the ultimate determining game of the season. The game comes down to one final drive, 2 hours after all of the other games have ended despite 2 other games starting at 3:25 due to a ref mutiny midway through the second quarter wherein one ref decided to let each coach have unlimited challenges.  Also, who wouldn't want a primetime  Raiders-Broncos game? The Raiders lose due to a block in the back call in the endzone of an intercepted hail mary forcing a safety. 

# DOOMSDAY HAS NOW BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT!!! ALL TEAMS 8-8!!!

Suddenly, we find ourselves in a completely unfamiliar and quite frankly scary situation. **Every team is not 8-8.** What the fuck happens now? Do we riot? Do we tell our deepest darkest secrets to me, a trustworthy individual? Do we do a little dance, make a little love, and get down tonight? Nah. We consult the NFL rule book. That right its tiebreaker time.

For the division:

1. ~~Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games among the clubs)~~
2. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division~~
3. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games~~
4. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference~~
5. ~~Strength of victory~~
6. ~~Strength of schedule~~
7. ~~Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed~~
8. ~~Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed~~
9. ~~Best net points in common games~~
10. ~~Best net points in all games~~
11. ~~Best net touchdowns in all games~~
12. ***A*** ***Coin toss***

That's right motherfuckers. **Random Chance** is the only true determinate. That brings me to my second point. The NFL is Harvey Dent from the Dark Knight, but that's a story for a different post.

Now, let's check out Wild Card matchups:

1. ~~Apply the division tiebreaker to eliminate all but the highest-ranked club in each division prior to proceeding to step 2. The original seeding within a division upon application of the division tiebreaker remains the same for all subsequent applications of the procedure that are necessary to identify the two wild card participants.~~
2. ~~Head-to-head sweep (applicable only if one club has defeated each of the others or if one club has lost to each of the others)~~
3. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference~~
4. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games, minimum of four~~
5. ~~Strength of victory~~
6. ~~Strength of schedule~~
7. ~~Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed~~
8. ~~Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed~~
9. ~~Best net points in conference games~~
10. ~~Best net points in all games~~
11. ~~Best net touchdowns in all games~~
12. ***A Coin toss***

We meet our one true god again. Coin Toss baby. Some of y'all might be wondering what about the seeding and I counter that with who the fuck cares. I mean at this point you kinda know. It's going to be a coin toss.

In conclusion,  Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Goodell? I don’t have a plan … a normal person has plans. competently run organizations have plans. You know what I am, Goodell? I am a dog chasing cars… I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it. I just do things. I am just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans. Yours, theirs, everyone’s. Tony Romo has plans. Even my father has plans. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I am not a schemer. I show the schemer how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say that you and the game of football was nothing personal, you know I am telling the truth. I just did what I do best. I took your plan and turned it on itself. Look what I have done to this city with a poorly written reddit post. Nobody panics when the expected people gets killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying.  If I tell the press that tomorrow Tom Brady bathes in the blood on newborns to maintain his youth, nobody panics. – because it’s all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old complete 8-8 season would happen, everybody loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I am an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos Goodell? IT is FAIR.

Like completely tied, like motherfucker triple-double knotted a shoe tied? Like Cincinnati Royals 1962-63 Dan **Tie**man tied?

We're talking about every team having the same record, points, touchdowns, yards, SoS, interceptions and domestic violence incidents. Well I wanted to know and I figured other people did too, so let me tell y'all what a quick 5 minute google search told me.

First lets set some parameters. Now y'all might be thinking that every team would go 0-0-16 in a league of full parity, however, y'all motherfuckers would be wrong. **8-8 is the one true record**. That's right I said it.

1. First of all 8 wins and 8 losses is a tie
2. A tie counts as half a win and half a loss so an 0-0-16 is the same record anyway according to the big man upstairs
3. I don't give a shit

So now that that's settled, the second parameter is that the Texans win the Superbowl in this scenario because I am heavily biased. Oh and the Colts finish last in the division and maybe the Patriots too because I don't like losing to them every year (seriously we've only won a game against them in our existence as a franchise)

That's it.

So let's zoom into the final game of the season. Here the Raiders and Broncos fight in what will be the ultimate determining game of the season. The game comes down to one final drive, 2 hours after all of the other games have ended despite 2 other games starting at 3:25 due to a ref mutiny midway through the second quarter wherein one ref decided to let each coach have unlimited challenges. Also, who wouldn't want a primetime Raiders-Broncos game? The Raiders lose due to a block in the back call in the endzone of an intercepted hail mary forcing a safety.

DOOMSDAY HAS NOW BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT!!! ALL TEAMS 8-8!!!

Suddenly, we find ourselves in a completely unfamiliar and quite frankly scary situation. **Every team is not 8-8.** What the fuck happens now? Do we riot? Do we tell our deepest darkest secrets to me, a trustworthy individual? Do we do a little dance, make a little love, and get down tonight? Nah. We consult the NFL rule book. That right its tiebreaker time.

For the division:

1. ~~Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games among the clubs)~~
2. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division~~
3. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games~~
4. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference~~
5. ~~Strength of victory~~
6. ~~Strength of schedule~~
7. ~~Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed~~
8. ~~Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed~~
9. ~~Best net points in common games~~
10. ~~Best net points in all games~~
11. ~~Best net touchdowns in all games~~
12. ***A*** ***Coin toss***

That's right motherfuckers. **Random Chance** is the only true determinate. That brings me to my second point. The NFL is Harvey Dent from the Dark Knight, but that's a story for a different post.

Now, let's check out Wild Card matchups:

1. ~~Apply the division tiebreaker to eliminate all but the highest-ranked club in each division prior to proceeding to step 2. The original seeding within a division upon application of the division tiebreaker remains the same for all subsequent applications of the procedure that are necessary to identify the two wild card participants.~~
2. ~~Head-to-head sweep (applicable only if one club has defeated each of the others or if one club has lost to each of the others)~~
3. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference~~
4. ~~Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games, minimum of four~~
5. ~~Strength of victory~~
6. ~~Strength of schedule~~
7. ~~Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed~~
8. ~~Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed~~
9. ~~Best net points in conference games~~
10. ~~Best net points in all games~~
11. ~~Best net touchdowns in all games~~
12. ***A Coin toss***

We meet our one true god again. Coin Toss baby. Some of y'all might be wondering what about the seeding and I counter that with who the fuck cares. I mean at this point you kinda know. It's going to be a coin toss.

In conclusion, Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Goodell? I don’t have a plan … a normal person has plans. competently run organizations have plans. You know what I am, Goodell? I am a dog chasing cars… I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it. I just do things. I am just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans. Yours, theirs, everyone’s. Tony Romo has plans. Even my father has plans. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I am not a schemer. I show the schemer how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say that you and the game of football was nothing personal, you know I am telling the truth. I just did what I do best. I took your plan and turned it on itself. Look what I have done to this city with a poorly written reddit post. Nobody panics when the expected people gets killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow Tom Brady bathes in the blood on newborns to maintain his youth, nobody panics. – because it’s all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old complete 8-8 season would happen, everybody loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I am an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos Goodell? IT is FAIR.

149,Who has the worst WR core in the NFL?,"Obviously, some teams WR cores are pretty bad, but whose do you think is the worst? I think the the Redskins take the cake, with their top 2 threats being Josh Doctson and Paul Richardson. No WR caught more than 2 TDs for them last year, and no WR caught 40 balls. In 16 frigging games, that is hard to do. With guys like Antonio Brown, Odell Beckham, Golden Tate, Tyrell Williams  and a dozen other former starters on the market, who did the Skins sign? Literally nobody. Hell they lost  Jamison Crowder, probably the best guy they had. What did they do in the draft? Not much to speak of.

Could the Dolphins or some other down troden WR core be worse? I guess, but it would be hard to see. Can you think of a worse Wide Receiver unit?",nfl,dirtydogs72,227,2019-07-02

His agent speaks into his ear (which you can clearly hear on the video) that the Broncos are moving to 2...and says with a smile.  Obviously this didnt happen which means it was contingent but the only contengency one could project that would make sense now that the draft is over is if the Browns took Barkley (who the Giants drafted) then the Giants move out of 2 and the Broncos take Mayfield.   The agent would not have such a reaction, nor would Mayfield if they didnt think that move was to take Mayfield.
Video link is below.  Decide for yourself.

This doesnt prove with absolute certainty but it certainly alludes to the fact that the Browns HAD to take Mayfield at 1 or he never makes it back to them.

My name is Taybor Pepper and I am currently competing for the Long Snapping spot at the New York Giants. I also played for the Green Bay Packers in 2017. I played 54 games in college at Michigan State and won:

2012 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl
2013 Big Ten Championship
2014 Rose Bowl
2015 Cotton Bowl
2015 Big Ten Championship

In addition to pursuing a career as a professional athlete, I have been streaming on Twitch for the past 6 months. I pride myself on the fact that when people tune into my channel they are surprised that a professional athlete knows so much about Twitch/gaming culture. I regularly game with streamers who consistently have a reach of 5,000+ concurrent viewers. Some of the streamers that I interact with regularly are Pokimane, Hasan Piker, Destiny, Trainwrecks, Xqc, and Rajj Patel.

I would like to build my Twitch channel to the point where I could gracefully transition my football career into a full time streaming career when my time as a player has run its course.

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

206,2018 Rookie QB Ranking,"1. I don’t think anybody can disagree with this. Baker Mayfield obviously. Don’t even need to say anything 
else.

2. Sam Darnold. This is where the hate comments will start rolling in, but he has a very good football IQ. He needs a lot of improvement in accuracy still, but with a better receiving core and more time to develop I see him throwing for 4,000yds and 25+ TDs. He almost had equal TD-Int ratio last year though, which is worrying.

3. Josh Allen. I don’t think anyone expected him to be so athletic. That hurdling play was insane. Not to mention, he has the strongest arm out of this class. He needs to work on accuracy though for sure. He has more interceptions than touchdowns. His team is also pretty bad, so you can’t put all the blame on him. IMO he has the most potential, but he hasn’t utilized it yet. Next season I could see him and Darnold possibly changing places.

4. Josh Rosen. He had a 57% completion rate last year which is just barely better than Allen. Once again. more INTs than touchdowns. He has also had the unfortunate luck of being on the two worst teams in the league. Once again, lots of potential not being utilized. He does everything good, but nothing great. I can’t see him ever being a top 10 QB but I also believe he can only get better from this point. He is good at short, or medium safe passes but isn’t going to wow you.

5. Lamar Jackson. He is like a slightly faster but much less accurate and strong RG3. He doesn’t fit in the league as a QB. I don’t see him having a career as a starter for much longer. Everything he does good, somebody else in the league does better. Yes, he’s fast but lacks everything else. I’m sure he will improve but I can’t see him ever being an elite player. Cue the angry Ravens fans in the comments calling me an idiot and downvoting this. Even y’all Baltimore fans know deep down I’m right, he is the only QB from this class I truly don’t see much potential in.",nfl,dawsonthedawg,28,2019-07-03

233,I think I have Matt Stafford's toenails,"*per the mods request, I am not officially claiming these for sure are his nails since I have no way of officially verifying it (it’s not like he signed them or anything)

I worked as a hotel maintenance guy for years. It’s not a glamorous job and it’s crazy how many years I let go by on autopilot. I was super depressed, and that depression grew every day.

The hotel I worked at was an upscale place in Minneapolis. We often had some famous people staying there, especially sports teams as we are near US Bank Stadium and the Target Center.

One January night in 2016, I was feeling super depressed (dead end job, long Minnesota winters) when I got called to one of the nice suites. There was an issue with the heater. I go up and who answers the door but Matt fricken Stafford! He explains to me that his heater had just slowed significantly and it was getting cold. He was super nice and was getting ready to leave for that nights game against the Vikings. (Man we were hyped for this Abdullah kid around then.)

So he’s in the shower/bathroom getting ready while I do my thing fixing the heater. While I’m down on my knees checking out the heater I notice something on the floor.... a toenail! I looked up at the table and on it is a toenail clippers he must have just been using. This toenail was the biggest toenail I’d ever seen, and tbh it was kind of gnarly. I quickly picked it up and looked around, I found a few more whole nails and a couple of shards. All in all I found 11 shards of nails that I believe to be his (we pretty thoroughly vacuum the suite every day). I kept them and finished my job and got out of there.

When I got home, I just sat there looking at his toe nails on my table. For the longest time I just sat there staring at them. I would roll them in my fingers, and I just couldn’t get over the fact that I (possibly) had parts of Matt Stafford in my hand!!

After awhile I started thinking more depressing thoughts again about my job. I then thought to myself; Matt has it all. He has family, fame, fortune and he’s very nice in person. You know, getting down on myself about the success of others.

I then looked at this gnarled toenail I was springing up and down between my fingers and realized: Matt. Stafford. Is. Just. A. Man. Like. Me.

He worked to get to where he is. He goes and gets what he wants. Family? Done. Fame? He crafted his story. Money? He did what he loved and held out to get paid his fair shake. He loves what he does and he loves his life, and Taco Tuesday....and yet he has to sit down.... every month.... just like me.... and clip his toenails.

For some reason it has always stuck with me. It’s kind of like realizing the president has to put his pants on in the mornings too or the Pope has to wipe himself clean in the bathroom just like you and me. We are all just people.

In the coming months I saved my money and started weaning myself off of my job I don’t like. Recently I quit and I am now following my dream: designing card games! This last winter I finally managed to step up and make the card game that when I get back from my honeymoon in two weeks will be something I can focus on bringing to full fruition. All thanks to Stafford and (possibly) his toenails.

246,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 37)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 37: 1956 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 30-December 23, 1956

Teams: 12

1956 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1956 First Draft Pick: Gary Glick, Safety from the Colorado A&amp;M (Pittsburgh Steelers)

1956 NFL Championship Game: New York Giants (8-3-1) defeated Chicago Beara (9-2-1) 47-7 at Yankee Stadium in New York City, New York.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-It is now illegal to grab an opponent's facemask (other than the ball carrier).

\-Using radio receivers to communicate with players on the field is prohibited.

\-The ball for night games was changed from white with black stripes to brown with white stripes.

With DuMont no longer airing games, CBS was brought in and began airing games during the regular season along with NBC (who still broadcast the title game).

The Chicago Cardinals got off to their best start ever, going 4–0, until the Redskins beat them 17–14 on October 28. At the midway point, they and the Giants had 5–1 records. In the Western Conference, the Detroit Lions roared to a 6–0 start. In Week 7 (November 11), the Giants pulled ahead with a 23–10 win over the Cards. In Washington, the Lions finally lost. Trapped on his own 1-yard line, Yale Lary took a safety in order to get a free kick. That, and Sam Baker's field goal, gave the Redskins an 18–10 lead to put the game out of reach, and the Lions lost 18–17. The Bears, who had dropped their opener at Baltimore, 28–21, beat Green Bay 38–14 for their 6th straight game, matching Detroit's 6–1 record.

In Week 9, the Lions dropped their Thanksgiving Day game as Tobin Rote guided Green Bay to 3 4th quarter touchdowns in a 24–20 win. On Sunday, the Cards 38–27 win over Pittsburgh put them a half game out. The Bears cancelled a loss, while the Giants watched a win elude them, as Harlon Hill caught a last-ditch 56-yard touchdown pass from Ed Brown in tying the Giants, 17–17. Both the Bears and the Giants continued to lead their conferences, but only by half a game.

The Cards lost the next 2 games and any chance at the Eastern title, which the Giants clinched, in part because of a 28–14 win over Washington on December 2. The Western race came down to the Bears and Lions. In Week 10 (December 2), the Lions hosted the Bears and won 42–10, to take the lead. When both teams won the following week, the trip to the championship came down to December 16, the last game of the season, which would have the 9–2 Detroit Lions visiting the 8–2–1 Chicago Bears, who hadn't forgotten the earlier drubbing. The game at Wrigley Field was marked by numerous fights, including a 4th quarter melee involving players, fans, and the police, and a vicious hit well behind the play by the Bears' Ed Meadows that knocked Detroit quarterback Bobby Layne out of the game with a concussion. So, the Bears exacted their revenge with a 38–21 victory. After the game Lions' coach Buddy Parker appealed to the commissioner to punish what the Lions felt was the dirty play of George Halas' Bears, but no ruling was forthcoming.

The 1956 NFL Championship Game would feature 2 teams who were no strangers to the title game. It was the first NFL title game in over half a decade to not feature the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, or Los Angeles Rams. It was also the first appearance in a title game for the Bears and Giants since the 1946 game at the Polo Grounds in New York. 

The 1956 Giants featured a number of Hall of Fame players, including running backs Frank Gifford and Alex Webster, offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown, linebacker Sam Huff, and defensive end Andy Robustelli. Two assistants of Giants head coach Jim Lee Howell, offensive coordinator Vince Lombardi and defensive coordinator Tom Landry, later became Hall of Fame head coaches with other franchises; Lombardi coached the Green Bay Packers to 5 NFL titles in the 1960s whil Landry led the Dallas Cowboys to 5 Super Bowls, with 2 wins during the 1970s.

The game was played on an icy field, with temperatures hovering around 20 °F (−7 °C). To adjust to the slick conditions, the Giants opted to wear sneakers instead of traditional football cleats. The advantage the white sneakers provided in footing was cited as a major factor in New York's romp. 22 years earlier on an icy Polo Grounds field, the Giants had employed the same tactic and beat the Bears to win the 1934 NFL Championship Game in the famous ""Sneakers Game"".

The Giants led 13–0 after the 1st quarter and built a 34–7 halftime lead on their way to a 47–7 win before 56,836. Although the home team, the Giants wore their white jerseys and the Bears their navy blue. New York's custom at the time was to alternate between blue and white jerseys at home. The blue jerseys were designated as the ""home jerseys"" beginning in 1957.

The 1956 NFL title was the Giants' fourth; they played in five of the six title games from 1958 through 1963, but did not win any of them. After the 1956 title, it was another 30years before their next, Super Bowl XXI in January 1987.

253,[OC] I ranked very current coordinator by their average finish in points,"Below is every offensive and defensive coordinator with at least 3 years of experience at that position, by their average finish in points. I'm only counting the years in which they were not the head coach entering the season (some have become interim head coaches in the middle of a season, and I counted those). I also only included points, because at the end of the day, how many yards a team gets or gives up doesn't mean as much as how may points they scored or allowed.

Note: There are a few teams, such as the Patriots and 49ers, that either don't have an OC/DC, or the head coach carries that title. I understand that actual responsibility of OC/DC varies greatly based off the background of their respective HC, and some coordinator's might get too much, or not enough credit for their side of the ball.",nfl,sip-em_bears,39,2019-07-03

274,"/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7-Round Tournament: Introduction to a Brand New Series","How good is your team at drafting in each round? Do they find stars early in the draft but fizzle out after? Do they stack up on talent and find hidden gems in the back end? Are there certain positions where they strike gold every time, and are there certain positions where they strike out every time?

Well, much like we did with the [/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c7s9ez/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_series_finale/?st=jxntk091&amp;sh=bbea1a62), where we looked at the best draft spot of all-time when assembling a team, we’re going to take the next month to find out the answer to the aforementioned question.

It’s 7-on-7 football with a twist. Introducing the **/r/NFL 7-on-7, 7 Round Tournament.**

How this works is going to take some explaining, because it’s bit more in-depth than the last series where it was basically just picking the best players at each position from a certain draft spot. We’re going to go down the line of every single team in the NFL, and assemble the best roster for a game of 7-on-7 football. Each team will have seven players on offense and seven players on defense. The seven players on offense and seven players on defense will be different. Players are not going to be playing two ways in this tournament. It’s going to be a roster of 14 players, with seven on each side of the ball. Here’s what each roster will comprise of:

Offense | Defense
--- | ---
QB | DE
HB | DE
WR | LB
HB/WR/TE (flex) | LB
OL | DB
OL | DB
OL/TE | JOKER (can be any defensive position)

On defense, I can have three defensive backs, three linebackers, or three defensive linemen. It doesn’t matter. On offense, I must have a minimum of two offensive linemen, and then either a third offensive lineman or a tight end; I must also have a minimum of one halfback and receiver, and then can have either a second receiver, a second halfback, or a tight end. While certain positions are pretty strict in what I must have, I do have some flexibility in other areas.

As for the rules of the players, this is where it gets unique:

- **On each side of the ball, I can only use one player per draft round.** There are seven rounds in the draft. I can only use one player that was drafted in the first round, one player that was drafted in the second round, etc.; once a round is used on a side of the ball, I can’t use it anymore. As an example, both Warren Sapp and Lee Roy Selmon were drafted by the Buccaneers in the first round of the NFL Draft; I cannot put both of them on the Bucs’ team, because they were both first round picks.

- **The players that make up each team had to make a contribution to said team.** In other words, accomplishments with other teams don’t count. As an example, Brett Favre is an amazing quarterback, but I can’t use him as the second round choice on offense for the Falcons, because he did absolutely nothing with them. Even if you drafted someone, they had to make an impact with your team; accomplishments with other teams do not count.

- **Undrafted players are ineligible for this list.** The purpose of this is to see how teams fare with their draft picks. If I let UDFAs into this, it gets really complicated and messy. So guys like Wayne Chrebet and Tony Romo won’t feature on this list.

- **Special teams is excluded from this.** Much like the last tournament I ran, we’re going to assume no kicking and no punting.

- **There is no restriction on how many players from a particular draft can be used.** As an example, in 2016, the Jaguars drafted Jalen Ramsey in the first round, Myles Jack in the second round, and Yannick Ngakoue in the third round. If I wanted to, I could use all three of those players for the Jaguars, since they were all drafted in different rounds. The year is irrelevant.

- **The seventh round slot includes any round past round seven.** The NFL Draft used to be longer than seven rounds. So, if I wanted to use a player from round eight, nine, or any other round past the seventh round, I can do that for that seventh round slot. It’s rounds 1-6, and round 7+.

- **Draft trades don’t count.** It just gets too messy if I do that. Philip Rivers doesn’t count for the Chargers, Eli Manning doesn’t count for the Giants, John Elway doesn’t count for the Broncos… you get the idea. Along the same lines, free agency doesn’t count; you had to be the one to draft that player. In other words, Drew Brees can’t play for the Saints.

- **I’m only counting the common draft.** Expansion drafts, supplemental drafts, and the USFL draft do not count.

Perhaps the most important thing to understand is that **this is not a series stating the best player ever drafted by each team in each round.** A lot of times, the best player drafted by a team at a certain spot won’t be on the list, because it’s about assembling the best team, and if I put said player on the list, it wouldn’t work. An example of this will be with the Ravens. I think everyone can agree that Jonathan Ogden is a better player than Joe Flacco, but I have to put Flacco at that first round spot over Ogden, because if I didn’t put Flacco there, the team would completely fall apart and would have no quarterback (I couldn’t use Tyrod Taylor because he did nothing in Baltimore). There are going to be lots of Hall of Famers that are off this list, and a lot of mediocre players that are on. At the end of the day, it’s about assembling the best team possible, not the best collection of players possible (with the Ravens, even though Ogden is the best offensive player ever taken by them, I’d rather have a team with Flacco and a worse offensive line than a team with Ogden and Chris Redman at quarterback). It’s a giant balancing act.

The other cool thing about this series is that with the last one, there wasn’t a whole lot of debate for spots. Maybe there were a few spots that were up in the air, but with a lot of the players, they were shoo-ins for their position. With this, you could legitimately assemble an entirely different team than me if you wanted to. If you value certain positions and certain players over others, you could go about this an entirely different way. If you would rather have a Hall of Fame player and mediocre players on one team instead of a collection of very good players, you can do that. This series is up for debate in terms of crafting your team.

So, with all of that said, here’s what the schedule of events should look like if everything goes to plan (it should take us to the end of the first week of the preseason):

- **7/3:** Introduction to the Series

- **7/5-7/8:** AFC East Teams

- **7/9-7/12:** NFC East Teams

- **7/13-7/16:** AFC South Teams

- **7/17-7/20:** NFC South Teams

- **7/21-7/24:** AFC North Teams

- **7/25-7/28:** NFC North Teams

- **7/29-8/1:** AFC West Teams

- **8/6-8/7:** Round of 32 Voting

- **8/8:** Sweet 16 Voting

- **8/9:** Elite Eight Voting

- **8/10:** Final Four Voting

- **8/11:** Championship Sunday

- **8/12:** Conclusion of the Series/Winner is Announced

He set a bunch of NFL and franchise records, but basically forced his way out of San Diego and never came close to matching that production elsewhere. Was out of the league by age 30.

345,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 38)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 38: 1957 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 29-December 22, 1957

Teams: 12

1957 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1957 First Draft Pick: Paul Hornung, Halfback from the University of Notre Dame (Green Bay Packers)

1957 AP Most Valuable Player: Jim Brown, Fullback (Cleveland Browns)

1957 NFL Championship Game: Detroit Lions (8-4-0) defeated Cleveland Browns (9-2-1) 59-14 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, MI.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-During sudden-death overtime, rules for time outs are the same as in a regular game, including the last two minutes of the second and fourth quarters.

\-Home teams wore dark jerseys and road team wore white. Previously, NFL teams were allowed to wear whatever uniform color they liked, even if it clashed with the other team, and were not required to have a white jersey.

Cleveland won its opener, 6–3 over the Giants, and led the Eastern Conference from wire to wire. A 17–7 loss to the Eagles in Week 4 forced the Browns to share the lead with New York, but the Giants lost the following week, and spent the rest of the season trying to catch Cleveland, which they would not accomplish.

The Western Conference race was more protracted. Baltimore, Detroit, and San Francisco were tied for the lead several times, and had identical 7–4 records at the end of the penultimate week. When 2 teams tied for first place, they would meet in a one-game playoff. The NFL did have a provision for that: ""If all 3 teams win, tie, or lose, then a 2-week playoff series begins next Sunday with Baltimore drawing a bye, San Francisco playing Detroit, and the winner meeting the Colts at Baltimore Dec. 29."" Detroit and San Francisco both won their regular season finales while starting their backup quarterbacks (Tobin Rote and rookie John Brodie, respectively), but the Colts lost, so the additional playoff never took place.

As the standard with a tie, the tied teams would face off in a playoff game to advance to the championship game. The Lions and 49ers met in San Francisco at Kezar Stadium. The 49ers at led 24-7 at the half and later 27-7, appearing to be heading for the championship game the following week. The Lions however mounted a comeback, with back-up Tobin Rote leading the Lions to rally and put up 24 unanswered points to win the game 31-27 and advance. It is looked at as one of the earliest and most significant major comebacks in the league's history.

The 1957 NFL Championship Game took place at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, MI. The game was a rematch from the 3-peat seen earlier in the decade as these teams met in 1952, 1953, and 1954's championship games. The Browns came into the game favored by 3 points.

The home underdog Lions were without starting quarterback Layne due to a broken ankle 3 weeks earlier against the Browns. Backup quarterback Tobin Rote filled in admirably following Layne's injury, winning every game, including a 24-point rally in the playoff the week prior against the 49ers. In his 8th season, Rote threw 4 touchdown passes in the title game, completing 12 of 19 passes for 280 yards, and also ran for a touchdown. Browns quarterbacks Tommy O'Connell and Milt Plum, on the other hand hit on a combined total of 9 of 22 passes for 112 yards. Taking full advantage of a pass interception and a fumble, Detroit ran up a 17–0 lead in the 1st quarter. Rookie running back and league MVP Jim Brown gave the Cleveland rooters some hope with a 29-yard touchdown run at the start of the 2nd period.

Things went from bad to worse for the Browns, hampered by injuries to quarterbacks O'Connell and Plum. The Lions romped for 14 points in each of the last 3 quarters, and won by 45 points, 59–14. In their final 6 quarters of play (including their previous divisional playoff), the Lions outscored their opponents 83-17 during the finish of the 1957 season. 

Until 2006, this was the last time that major professional teams from Michigan and Ohio met in a postseason series or game. As of 2018, this was the last playoff game played in the city of Detroit other than Super Bowl XL in 2006. The Lions other two home playoff games since 1957 (1991 and 1993) were played at the Pontiac Silverdome in nearby Pontiac, MI.

Not only was this the most recent title for the Lions, it is also the last time they have appeared in a title game as of today. The closest they ever got to making it to the title game was in 1991 when they lost the NFC Championship game to the Washington Redskins.

353,What teams are least screwed if their starting quarterback goes down this season?,"Whether they have a bad starting QB in the first place or just an excellent backup, which teams will still be just as competitive (or as close as possible) with their backup QB?

My choice would be the Dolphins, because they are planning on starting Rosen at some point, anyway.",nfl,GawainOfTheSpaceCats,124,2019-07-04
355,Reshuffling the divisions in a way where every team has a chance to win their division,"We know for a fact that teams like the Giants and Dolphins are probably not going to compete anytime soon. But what if we structured the divisions in a way where every team is competitive to win their division? 

Divisions would be determined based on how you performed relative to the entire league. For example: one division would be the top 4 teams by record (Saints, Chiefs, Rams and Bears). As for determining which divisions are placed in which conference, I would alternate based on strength of division. For example: the division with the top 4 teams would be placed in one conference while the 5-8 best teams are placed in the other.

Based on last years results, here is what the new divisions for 2019 would look like:

**Conference 1:**

|*East*|*North*|*South*|*West*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Saints|Cowboys|Falcons|Bills|
|Rams|Seahawks|Redskins|Giants|
|Chiefs|Colts|Panthers|Jags|
|Bears|Steelers|Dolphins|Bugs|

&amp;#x200B;

**Conference 2:**

|*East*|*North*|*South*|*West*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chargers|Eagles|Packers|49ers|
|Patriots|TItans|Broncos|Jets|
|Texans|Vikings|Lions|Raiders|
|Ravens|Browns|Bengals|Cardinals|

&amp;#x200B;

In this system, teams like the Patriots wouldn't be shoo-ins for the playoffs every year and every team would be competitive to win their division. Every fanbase can be excited because their team actually has a chance of making the playoffs. Just an interesting way to up the competition.

Obviously I don't support this system but I think it's fun to think about.",nfl,KingMeruem12,63,2019-07-04

**PFL**

Congrats to the final 12, you have made it to the Playoffs of the NFL, and the Playoffs of the NFL Survivor. No more tribes, no more immunity, it's just the last set of all of you.

The new merged tribe, the Playoff Football League has emerged, and all teams are highlighted in their original conference when the season started.

It's down to this, only the best of the best will win, and be crowned /r/NFL Survivor.

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  

If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/PlunderBirdHunters, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS, /r/HoofsAndClawsBrigade .) Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users. (Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)

370,If the loser of every Super Bowl actually won...,"Going through the history of the Super Bowls has given the the idea to look at some interesting stats of these games if we flipped the winners. Who would be the historically best in the league when it comes to titles in the Super Bowl era? For the sake of defining what a dynasty is, any team that had 3+ titles in a short period of time, let's say 8 years. Here are some highlights:

**Most titles**: Patriots and Broncos (5)

**Most consecutive wins**: Bills (4)

**Dynasties**: Vikings (Super Bowls 4, 8, 9, 11), Broncos (Super Bowls 21, 22, 24), Bills (Super Bowls 25, 26, 27, 28) \[These are also the only teams to have any repeats if they won instead\]

**List of wins by current teams**:

5: Broncos, Patriots

4: Bills, Vikings

3: Cowboys, Dolphins, Rams

2: Bengals, Colts, Eagles, Falcons, Panthers, Raiders, Redskins, Seahawks, Steelers

1: Bears, Cardinals, Chargers, Chiefs, 49ers, Packers

0: Buccaneers, Jets, Ravens, Saints

0 appearances still: Browns, Jaguars, Lions, Texans

**QBs with multiple titles as a starter**:

4: Jim Kelly (Bills)

3: Frank Tarkenton (Vikings), John Elway (Broncos), Tom Brady (Patriots)

2: Roger Staubach (Cowboys), Craig Morton (Broncos/Cowboys), Peyton Manning (Colts/Broncos), Kurt Warner (Cardinals/Rams)

**QBs who wouldn't have a title after multiple appearances**:

Troy Aikman (0-3), Joe Montana (0-4), Terry Bradshaw (0-4), Troy Aikman (0-3), Eli Manning (0-2), Bart Starr (0-2), Jim Plunkett (0-2)

**QBs who were 0-1 despite having notable careers**:

Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers, Joe Flacco, Ken Stabler, Johnny Unitas, Steve Young, Phil Simms

**QBs who would have their only title (some so far)**:

Ben Roethlisberger, Jared Goff, Matt Ryan, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson (still technically only has 1), Brett Favre (still only 1), Drew Bledsoe, Colin Kaepernick, Matt Hasselbeck, Donovan McNabb, Steve McNair, Bob Griese

The NFL clearly would have some parity, a lot of it actually in the last 25 years with no team really establishing themselves as a powerhouse since the Bills during the SB25-28 years. The only thing that doesn't change...the New England Patriots at the top of the mountain in the Super Bowl era.",nfl,ThatPackerFan,37,2019-07-04

Especially after the Saints getting in trouble for bountygate, and with this premeditated assault on a qb, it would obviously be a massive suspension, but how bad would you think it would be?

424,NFL vs NBA,"NBA is better for the following reasons:

**(1) Basketball &gt; Football.** Requires more skill, more fun, players don't get permanent brain damage

**(2) Star Players and narratives.** NBA just has better superstars that are generally more interesting. In the NFL there are some guys like AB and Odell Beckham who stir up some drama, but it's not even comparable to the NBA. In the NFL most players are pretty boring and straightforward, really just not that interesting. Plus in general in the NBA it's a lot easier to get invested in the players and the teams, whereas in the NFL each team is basically just like 50 random dudes hitting each other. It's just a cluster. 

**(3) Domestic violence in the NFL.** I just feel like there is a disproportionate amount of awful human beings who play in the NFL compared to the NBA. Every year there are at least 2 or 3 NFL players who commit acts of domestic violence, and often the players go unpunished.",nfl,CellarDoor808,192,2019-07-04

Sure he can run and tackle but he cannot catch  a pass from even a few yards away! The worst is he is always fumbling, what is so hard about holding onto that football and not letting go? His arms are swol as shit so he has no excuse for fumbles. and he passes, my God is there any NFL  with worse arming? It never goes anywhere near where he is trying to throw it.

Elite speed, and he glides effortlessly while running. And to top it all of, he killed it last year. 2028 all purpose yards and 15 total touchdowns as a rookie. He put that Giants train wreck of an offense on his back. He will only get better. He has passed every back in the league in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it looks like the Cardinals, Browns, Titans and Chiefs all have dedicated mini series for their teams off seasons. Personally, I think this is something all teams should invest in, most fans  love the inside look at their favorite team, it's also kind of why hard knocks is so successful! I think it helps keep the fan connected and makes them feel like their apart of the team! Hope you all enjoy the rest of the off season.

454,Beginner in NFL,"Hi, I have just started learning the rules of NFL. As I watched a game, the quarterback threw an incomplete pass at 3rd down, 7 yards. When I looked up the rules, it said that after an incomplete pass, the down is basically wasted and the play is restarted by the offense at the last line of scrimmage. However, in the above game that I was talking about, the offense started the play at the last line of scrimmage but it showed it was 1st and 10 yards... how is that possible?

Over the next month, I’m going to be looking at all 32 teams in the NFL, and determining the best 7-on-7 teams in franchise history. However, there is a twist to this series; I am only allowed to use one player on each side of the ball per round, so I can only use one player from the first round, one from the second round, and so on and so forth. It’s also important to note that throughout the course of this series, some really good players may be omitted for some really mediocre players; this is an exercise in picking the best team, and not the best individual players (so a Hall of Famer may have to be on the outside looking in if his inclusion makes a position group really weak).

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the 7-on-7 team for the **Buffalo Bills.**

**Makeup of the Team**

Because of the unique nature of this series, since it’s not just about taking the top seven players (you’re restricted by draft rounds), I wanted to take you inside my thought process when constructing my team.

**Offense:** The first thing I always look at is the QB position, because you can’t win without one. Is there any QB that the Bills drafted in a later round that played for the Bills that could give this team a legitimate chance at competing? Joe Ferguson was a third round pick, but the drop-off between him and Kelly wasn’t worth it. If I was considering Daryle Lamonica’s entire career (all 12 seasons and not just the four that he played with Buffalo), I would’ve easily put him ahead of Kelly so that the first round spot is open for a Hall of Fame level talent, like OJ Simpson or Joe DeLamielleure. But, seeing as I’m only factoring in what they did with the team that drafted them, I opted against it. I had to burn the first round spot on a QB; fortunately, the Bills have a really good one in Jim Kelly.

Next, I always try and plug in the Hall of Famers. This one was easy- Thurman Thomas takes the second round spot, and Andre Reed takes the fourth round spot. As for making up the rest of the team, it’s a matter of looking at the rounds and seeing if your hands are tied at any spot. In the sixth round, this was the case; the only two guys that did anything of note with the Bills were Corbin Lacina and Dusty Zeigler, both of whom were offensive linemen. This means that the sixth round spot has to go on the offensive line. The same problem occurs in the fifth round; the only noteworthy player drafted that did anything with the Bills was Donnie Green, who’s on the offensive line. 

Only two rounds are free- the third and the seventh. I still have to fill a flex spot and an OL/TE spot. There were a few combinations to choose from. I could’ve gone with an offensive lineman in the third and a wide receiver in the seventh by choosing Glenn Parker (third) and Steve Johnson (seventh), or I could’ve gone with a wide receiver in the third and an offensive lineman in the seventh by choosing Don Beebe (third) and Howard Ballard (seventh). In the end, I went with Beebe and Ballard, simply because the drop-off from Steve Johnson to Don Beebe was less than the drop-off from Howard Ballard to Glenn Parker; plus, the offensive line would look less than stellar without Ballard, while the receiving core is still pretty good with Andre Reed. Jim Braxton was also an option here for the third round spot, but I opted for a second receiver over a second halfback.

**Defense:** Bruce Smith was the obvious call for the first round spot; he’s the all-time leader in sacks, and is the only Hall of Famer that the Bills drafted on defense that wound up playing for them. After that, I looked to see if there were any rounds where I was going to have my hands tied. In the sixth round, the Bills have only drafted three starters, and all three of them (John Skorupan, Arthur Moats, Keith Ellison) played linebacker, so the sixth round spot had to be a linebacker. Kyle Williams had to get the fifth round spot; he’s the only player to make a Pro Bowl that was drafted in the fifth round on defense, and he’s made six of them. Additionally, his 178 starts were far and away the top total of any of those players. This problem also occurred in the third round; Ben Williams was the only Pro Bowler drafted in that spot, and while Eugene Marve’s overall career wasn’t bad by any means, he only spent half of it in Buffalo.

After going through those four rounds, all three defensive line spots were taken. Now, it was about finding the best defensive backs possible, as well as the best remaining linebacker. Butch Byrd in the fourth round was a no-brainer; the only other fourth rounder of note was Terrence McGee, but much like Byrd, McGee was a defensive back, so using a fourth round spot on a DB was never a question. This left two possible combinations- a defensive back in the second round (Jairus Byrd or Nate Odomes) and a linebacker in the seventh round (Mike Stratton), or a linebacker in the second round (Darryl Talley) and a defensive back in the seventh round (Mike Nelms). In the end, the drop-off between Byrd/Odomes and Nelms was marginal, but the drop-off between Stratton (a member of an all-decade team) and Talley was somewhat big. So, I opted for that combination.

**/r/NFL Rates**

How good is this team? That’s where I want you guys to come in so that there’s an interactive element before we do the postseason voting in a month. Based on the roster that you saw, how far do you think this team can go? Will they be a first round exit, or will they make it all the way to the championship?

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18272414)**

Note that for seeding purposes, I’m going to split it up between the AFC and NFC, and will rank the teams 1-16 in each conference based off of their lifetime winning percentage.

**Final Thoughts**

There are definitely some weak links on this team. The offensive line could use some work, and John Skorupan at one of the starting linebacker spots isn’t necessarily ideal. However, this team could be really good when all is said and done. They’ve got a Hall of Fame quarterback with Hall of Fame weapons around him (it’s basically the early 90s Bills offense), and on defense, a defensive line with Bruce Smith, Kyle Williams, and Ben Williams is going to be tough to block. When everyone on the defensive line has made it to a Pro Bowl, has made it to a combined 18 Pro Bowls, and has a combined 265 sacks (unofficially), you know that’s going to be a tough out. Buffalo might be able to win a few games when the time comes in the tournament.

I kind of wanted to basically start everything over.""","Source from [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1060947/2019/07/03/this-week-in-bengals-the-reason-for-john-ross-number-change/). Relevant part listed below since article is behind a paywall:

&gt; Upon being drafted by the Bengals No. 11 was on his mind but already taken by Brandon LaFell. Ross ended up with No. 15.

&gt; There’s not much worth remembering from the two-year run of that number.

&gt; With a new coaching staff comes new hope for Ross. They view him as having untapped potential and capable of much bigger things than just a red-zone weapon with threatening speed.

&gt; Ross made clear this change is about much more than just liking the way a number looks.

&gt; “I felt like, this is my third year, I get a chance to re-invent myself and re-create some of the old me,” Ross said. “I kind of wanted to basically start everything over. I get to put Ross III on the back of my jersey and get to change the number. Hopefully, just change the whole year.”

&gt; How much does Ross want to re-invent himself? Well, this process isn’t as easy as one would think. In order to switch jersey numbers, you have to buy out all the No. 15 jerseys in stock anywhere from the NFL. You’re stuck with the number until you do.

&gt; He’s still going through the rigamarole of making that happen. Hence, why he wore No. 15 during minicamp.

&gt; “It’s still crazy,” Ross said. “But it’s something I was passionate about. It’s not like I’m actually buying something that is useless or would throw away. I see it like somebody else purchasing like a diamond chain or something. I’m doing it based off something I really want. It’s actually, I do this for a living. It’s not like it’s a waste of money. It’s all planned out and something I wanted to do.”",nfl,JaguarGator9,78,2019-07-05

485,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 39)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 39: 1958 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 28-December 14, 1958

Teams: 12

1958 NFL Draft: 360 selections (30 rounds), held in Philadelphia, PA.

1958 First Draft Pick: King Hill, Quarterback from Rice University (Chicago Cardinals)

1958 AP Most Valuable Player: Jim Brown, Fullback (Cleveland Browns)

1958 NFL Championship Game: Baltimore Colts (9-3-0) defeated New York Giants (9-3-0) 23-17 (OT) at Yankee Stadium in New York City, New York.

The 1958 season is regarded as a watershed year in which the popularity of professional football in the United States began to rival that of baseball in the public imagination. ""Professional football was beyond coming of age in 1958,"" one writer enthused, ""it was on an even plane with baseball as the game of the people.""

Stadium attendance was robust throughout the league, with crowds in excess of 100,000 twice filling the Los Angeles Coliseum to see the Los Angeles Rams, while the Detroit Lions  managed to sell a staggering 42,000 season tickets in advance of the 1958 campaign, ensuring home sellouts at Briggs Stadium.

The Western Conference race was over after ten games, with the Colts at 9–1, and the Bears and Rams mathematically eliminated at 6–4. The Colts lost their final 2 games on the road in California to finish at 9–3, a game ahead of Chicago and Los Angeles.

The Cleveland Browns led the Eastern Conference title race up until the final week. On December 14, the 9–2 Browns visited the 8–3 Giants. As a snowstorm swept over Yankee Stadium, the Browns' 10–3 lead gave way to a 10–10 tie game on Frank Gifford's pass to Bob Schnelker, which would still have suited Cleveland. The Giants' Pat Summerall missed a 31-yard field goal with 4:30  left. With 2 minutes to play, Summerall had another opportunity from 49 yards out, in inclement weather and connected for a 13–10 win. The Browns and Giants finished with 9–3 records, forcing a playoff for a trip to the championship game. The Giants would prevail in a 10-0 shutout at Yankee Stadium.

The 1958 NFL Championship Game has become widely known as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"". The game was played at Yankee Stadium in New York City, New York featuring an attendance of 64,185 with an estimated 45 million watching on television.

The game got off to a rough start for both teams. On Baltimore's first drive, New York linebacker Sam Huff forced a fumble while sacking Johnny Unitas. Defensive back Jimmy Patton recovered the ball at the Colts 37. One play later, Baltimore took the ball back when defensive end Gino Marchetti forced a recovered fumble from quarterback Don Heinrich. But all the Colts managed to do with their next drive was lose another turnover when a Unitas pass was picked off by Lindon Crow. After forcing a punt, Unitas completed a 60-yard pass to Lenny Moore at the Giants' 26-yard line. But Baltimore's drive was halted at the 19 and Steve Myhra's field goal attempt was blocked by Huff.

On the Giants next drive, Heinrich was replaced by Charley Conerly for the rest of the game. New York then drove to the Colts' 30-yard line, featuring a 38-yard run by Frank Gifford.

On third down, Conerly threw a pass to wide-open fullback Alex Webster, but he slipped before the ball arrived and it fell incomplete. Pat Summerall then kicked a 36-yard field goal to put New York on the board. In the second quarter, Baltimore defensive end Ray Krouse recovered a fumble from Gifford to set up a 2-yard touchdown run by Colts running back Alan Ameche. On their next drive, New York got a big scoring opportunity when they recovered a fumbled punt from Jackie Simpson on the Colts 10-yard line. But a few plays later, Gifford fumbled again, and Baltimore lineman Don Joyce recovered on his own 14. The Colts subsequently drove 86 yards in 15 plays, including a 16-yard scramble by Unitas on 3rd and 7, to score on Unitas' 15-yard touchdown pass to Raymond Berry, giving them a 14–3 halftime lead.

That fumble by Gifford and the fumble later were forced by defensive back Milt Davis of the Colts—despite playing with two broken bones in his right foot—and both led to touchdowns for the Colts.

Then early in the third quarter, Baltimore reached the New York 1-yard line. But on third down, Ameche was stopped for no gain, and the Colts turned it over on downs after Ameche was tackled trying to go wide at the 5-yard line on a great play by linebacker Cliff Livingston, on a fourth down halfback option play. It was a huge reversal of momentum.

The Giants then went 95-yards in just four plays, scoring on Mel Triplett's 1-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 4, with a score of 14–10. The drive was highlighted by an unforgettable 86-yard pass play from deep within the Giants own territory at the closed end of the stadium: Quarterback Conerly threw to Kyle Rote downfield left-to-right across the middle where Rote then broke an arm tackle at about mid-field; then Rote fumbled when hit from behind at the Colts 25, but Webster, who was trailing the play, picked up the ball and ran it all the way to the 1-yard line where he was knocked out of bounds.

The Giants took a 17–14 lead early in the fourth quarter with Conerly's 46-yard completion to tight end Bob Schnelker setting up his 15-yard touchdown pass to Gifford. On both of Baltimore's next drives they moved the ball into scoring range, but came up empty both times. First they drove to the Giants 39-yard line, only to have Bert Rechichar miss a 46-yard field goal. Then they got the ball back on the New York 42 following a fumble recovery by Joyce. But after driving to the 27-yard line, Unitas was sacked twice in a row (once by Andy Robustelli and once by Dick Modzelweski), moving the ball back 20 yards and pushing the Colts out of field goal range.

Faced with fourth down and inches on their own 40-yard on their ensuing drive, New York decided to punt with a little over two minutes left in the game (on the third down play before the punt, Marchetti was knocked out of the game with a broken ankle. He refused to leave for medical treatment and watched the rest of the game sitting up on a stretcher on the sidelines). The Colts took over at their own 14-yard line and Unitas engineered one of the most famous drives in football history—a 2-minute drill before anyone called it that. After starting the drive with two incompletions, Unitas made a critical 11-yard completion to Moore on third down. Following one more incompletion, he threw three consecutive passes to Berry, moving the ball 62 yards to the Giants 13-yard line. This set up a 20-yard tying field goal by Myhra with seven seconds left to send the game into sudden-death overtime—the first overtime game in NFL playoff history. As Unitas later stated, the players had never heard of overtime before the game. ""When the game ended in a tie, we were standing on the sidelines waiting to see what came next. All of a sudden, the officials came over and said, 'Send the captain out. We're going to flip a coin to see who will receive.' That was the first we heard of the overtime period."" An NFL preseason exhibition game played three years earlier in Portland, Oregon, had been settled by sudden-death overtime, but this was the first time an NFL game of any significance needed overtime to determine a winner. Bert Bell, the commissioner of the NFL, had just implemented the sudden-death overtime rule for this game.

The overtime rule stipulated that a coin toss would be held at midfield. The available player-captains of the respective teams would attend it and the visiting team would choose heads or tails. The winning side of the toss would choose whether to receive the ball or kick off. Unitas called for the Colts and lost the toss. With Marchetti injured and on the sidelines, head referee Ron Gibbs gave the instructions to Colt co-captain Unitas, and Giants' co-captains Rote and Bill Svoboda: 'The first team to score, field goal, safety, or touchdown, will win the game, and the game will be over.'

Don Maynard received the opening kickoff for the Giants and muffed the catch, but recovered it on the Giants 20-yard line. Even in his autobiography *You Can't Catch Sunshine*, Maynard states that he was not only disappointed in the botched attempt, but also at the commentators for saying he fumbled the ball due to their lack of knowledge of football and its terminology by not knowing the difference between a fumble and muffing the ball. After a *three-and-out series*, the Giants punted. On their ensuing drive, Baltimore drove 80 yards in 13 plays (all called by QB Johnny Unitas) on a tired NY defense. Ameche made several critical plays on the drive, catching an 8-yard pass on 3rd and 8 from the Colts 33, and later rushing 22 yards to the Giants 20-yard line. Berry also made a big impact, catching two passes for 33 yards, including a 12-yard reception on the New York 8. Following a 1-yard run by Ameche and a 6-yard catch by tight end Jim Mutscheller, Ameche scored on a third down 1-yard touchdown run with 6:45 left to win the game, 23–17.

This game stands as 1 of only 2 NFL title games to be decided in overtime, the next one wouldn't occur until Super Bowl LI between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons.

Apologize for being a day late, I know you all couldn't wait for this.   
  
For a schedule of posts, you can head over to the [Methodology and Hub Post](https://www.reddit.com/blrm1j). You can follow the links to see past weeks lists and follow ups.
 
Each week will follow roughly the same formula, with a couple of random additions week to week based on conversations in the comments of the current week’s list.
 
To lead off each week you’ll have the lists being discussed so you can get caught up:
 
#PART 1 - POLL
 
The below link below features a quick poll for the players ranked #30 thru 21. Please fill out the poll since I’m sure you’re all itching to let us know what you think!
 
##[User Poll - #30-21](https://forms.gle/GS5Lr8rgcT3EPogA8)*

The second piece each week will be a small write up from one of the Top 100 rankers, explaining their methodology for how they determined their own personal Top 100 list. The hope is that not only will these write ups better inform the readers to our processes, but it is also in the hopes that maybe (just maybe) one of the readers sees them and decides to apply next season to join us.) Please note that not every ranker will give you their full process, so please don’t go after them if they don’t explain something to your liking. Pinging then and asking respectful questions will go a lot further in getting you any answers you are missing.)
 
#PART 2 - RANKER’S CORNER
 
This one is from /u/wrhslax1996 [](/PHI). This was his first year as a ranker.  
  
&gt;Greetings. I'm going to provide a brief rundown of how I evaluated players for my top 100 list. This was my first year as a ranker, so the process was new to me. I don't claim that this process is perfect and its something I hope to improve for next season. I am open to any ideas for improving/revamping my strategy.

&gt;First and foremost, I compiled the list of nominated players, divided them up by position, and put them into a spreadsheet. I did not want to factor in positional importance with my list, so my plan was to find various statistics (especially efficiency stats) for each player, find out the average of the nominated players in each of those statistics, and figure out who was the best, statistically, relative to the top players at each position. To provide an example, I'll take a deeper dive into my process for the WRs. Also, I came up with a nominal 13+ games played threshold. I figured playing more than 75% of a season was a reasonable cutoff point to avoid relying too heavily on pure efficiency. 

&gt;The nominated WRs were: Humphries, Thielen, Cooper, MBC, B. Cooks, D. Adams, Nuk, D. Baldwin, J. Landry, Juju, Julio, K. Allen, K. Golladay, L. Fitzgerald, Michael Thomas, Mike Evans, OBJ, R. Woods, S. Diggs, TY Hilton, T. Boyd, T. Lockett, T. Hill. I accumulated the following statistics for each of them: targets, targets/game, receptions, receptions/game, rec. yards, ypg, rec. TDs, yards/route run, yards/rec, 1st downs, 1st downs/game, drops, drops/target, target QB rating, yac, and yac/reception. I figured that spread of statistics would at least give me a somewhat solid overview of how they stacked up against one another both in terms of efficiency and volume. I then took the average of each statistic and compared each player to that average. For example, the average yards/route run in this group for the 2018 season was 2.12. Anyone above that number was shaded green, anyone below was shaded orange. I did that for every statistic in order to see which WRs stacked up best against the other WRs. Any player who had red across most/all of the statistics (meaning they were statistically below average compared to the top 2018 WRs) was a longer shot to make the list. Some of the nominated WRs who were immediately long shots by this process were: Adam Humphries, Amari Cooper, Brandon Cooks (had the bulk yards, but that was pretty much all he came in above average in other than drops), Doug Baldwin, Jarvis Landry, Kenny Golladay, Larry Fitzgerald, Tyler Boyd, Tyler Lockett (perfect target QB rating but was only thrown to 70 times which was the lowest of any WR nominated). That helped put 10/23 nominations on the backburner. Meanwhile, my games played threshold allowed me to do the same with OBJ. With the remaining 12 players, it turned into a stat comparison/film watching (via all-22 and twitter links) to see who really excelled as route runners, who was strong at the point of the catch, who was consistently beating CBs, etc when it came down to ranking the WRs. 

&gt;I did that with every group and finally had positional rankings. From there, it was a lot of eye-test and how above average, relative to their positions, they were in order to determine their placement on my top 100 list. This was definitely the hardest part of the list, but it was also the most fun part, if I'm being honest. There's really no right or wrong way to compare a RB to an OT or a CB to a DT, it's all in the eyes of whoever is ranking the player. 

&gt;In summary, this year my rankings relied pretty heavily on who played the best at their respective positions and who was able to, for lack of a better phrase, separate themselves from the pack the most. It's not perfect, but I felt that, for the most part, my list was pretty decent (though I'm sure you'll find some headscratchers on every list you look at).

# PART 4 - THE SPECIALISTS
 
You all wanted us to rank kickers and punters within the list, according to last year’s polls, but to be totally honest this list has never really been able to quantify the worth of a kicker or punter against other positions because of the lack of meaningful snaps in comparison to other players on the list.
 
For this reason, after rankings had been completed I asked rankers to rank kickers and punters from a list if they wanted to. Those who did ranked 10 out of the top 20 kickers (based on total points in 2018) and 10 out of the top 20 punters (based on gross average per punt). Yes, I am aware that this knocked [insert your K/P here] out of the list and it is an abomination because they [did this totally amazing thing or had this great stat] in 2017. Please understand that this list has no bearing on anything, anywhere, and getting frustrated over it will really just end up giving you heart palpitations in the long run, and no one needs that.
 
***KICKER #3*** - **GREG ZUERLEIN** [](/LAR)
 
| GAMES | FGA | FGM | LONG FG | XPA | XPM | POINTS |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 11 | 31| 27| 56 yds | 36| 35| 116 |
 
Zuerlein is already excited for the next chapter in his career as an NFL head coach given his top qualities - being with McVay. 
 
***PUNTER #4*** - **THOMAS MORSTEAD** [](/NO)
 
| GAMES | PUNTS | YARDS | BLOCKED | LONG |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 16 | 43 | 1996| 0 | 60 yds |
 
Rated well for having the easiest job in the NFL last season. Tough life for this guy.

In fact the defense was labeled as good enough considering how good the offense was. I looked at their defensive ranks, and it's not bad. It's about average for the most part minus a few stats. But why werent they better? Best defensive player in the league and Wade Phillips as DC, great right? Traded for Peters, Fowler and Talib(damn injuries). Signed Suh. Maybe expectations were too high?

The criteria for who I can and cannot put on that team is listed in the introductory post; remember that if a great player from the 1960s is not on this list, odds are that he got drafted twice (once by the NFL and once by the AFL) and I put him on another team that needed him more.

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the #1 team of all time comprised solely of #25 picks.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses**

**Strengths:** There doesn’t appear to be a weak link when it comes to the linebackers on this team. Jon Beason, Dont’a Hightower, and Lee Roy Caffey are all very good players, and while there may not be a standout compared to some of the other linebackers in this tournament, there’s no weak link. Boyd Dowler at tight end is a good piece, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone abysmal on the offensive line, as everyone there can, at the very least, hold their own. Plus, a secondary with an AFL-great in Byrd and one of the best corners in football right now in Rhodes is going to be tough to throw on.

**Weaknesses:** Is there any true star power on the offense? Jason Campbell isn’t a great option at QB, the running game isn’t anything special, and while there’s nobody bad at wide receiver by any means, this unit could struggle against some of the better secondary units in the tournament. On the defensive line, the pass rush is severely lacking; Ted Washington is really good, and outside of him, this team may get stonewalled by better offensive lines. And at safety, the two starting safeties combined for zero Pro Bowls and zero First Team All Pros in their careers, so it’s a definite weak spot.

**/r/NFL Poll Question of the Day**

 You guys are eventually going to vote on the bracket and which team advances in each round. However, to get you guys engaged during this month-long process when I’m going through the teams, I’m going to do a simple Strawpoll question a day regarding the roster makeup of the team in question. Because today’s post is about the team of #25 draft picks, today’s question will be about the cornerback controversy on this team.

**There were four players that warranted consideration to start at cornerback alongside Butch Byrd. Those players were Bobby Butler, Vontae Davis, Mike Jenkins, and Xavier Rhodes. Who is the best option to start at cornerback?**

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18179916)**

---

**Final Thoughts**

This team could struggle when it comes time to vote on the winners. The highs on this team are good but not spectacular, and there’s a lot of parts on the team that are mediocre at best when compared to the rest of the field. Jason Campbell isn’t terrible (though he’s not great), but there’s not a lot to work with on the offensive side of the ball. Combined with a lackluster pass rush and some other lackluster pieces, and this team may be on the weaker side of things. However, that’ll be up to you guys to decide when the time comes.

We’ll do the team of #26 picks tomorrow at 9:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day at 9:00 ET for the next team’s roster.

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.
   

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|

|Ravens|Cardinals|
|Bills|~~Falcons~~|
|Bengals|Panthers|
|Browns|Bears|

34,"Montana, Marino, and Elway: the Glassjaw Joe Problem","For me, Joe Montana was always the pretty clear answer to the GOAT QB question up until the last half-decade or so. But one thing that I don't think gets raised enough as a knock when Montana is compared to other pantheon QBs is his distinct fragility: he played very few seasons wire to wire and was knocked out of games more often than most of the QBs he gets compared against.

It *is* true that Montana played through a 9 game strike-shortened season in 1982 and a 15 game season in 1987. It is also true that he played in an era that was tougher on QBs: the NFL began tightening and changing rules to protect QBs in '93, with probably the two most notable beneficial changes to prevent injuries coming in '95 and '07.

But compare Montana to two of his pantheon peers, whose careers largely overlapped with his:

Quarterback|Era|16 start seasons|500+ attempt seasons|400+ attempt seasons|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Dan Marino|'83-'99|11|11|13
John Elway|'83-'98|7|6|12
Joe Montana|'79-'94|2|2|6

The 500+ and 400+ attempt season numbers are, of course, only rough proxies for durability: those numbers are also influenced by offensive style. While we think of the West Coast offense as being a pass-happy offense, and intuitively you'd expect an offense famous for short, relatively horizontal passes to result in high attempts, it appears to have *not* been as pass-happy an offense as you might expect, at least not when compared to the offenses helmed by other elite QBs in that era.

For their careers, in 16 years from start to finish Montana had 164 starts and Elway had 231. In 17 years Marino had 240. Notably, even if Montana had started every game of his rookie and sophomore years, *and* if he'd started every game of '91 and '92, one of which he missed entirely due to injury and one of which he missed entirely due to a mix of injury and Steve Young, *and* even if we assume that the '82 season hadn't been strike-shortened and Montana had started every game, even that would only have taken Montana to 227 games, still less than Elway--and from what we know of the rest of Montana's career the assumption that he would have started 16 games in each of those seasons seems *extremely* generous.

For me, all of this doesn't change my all-time QB ranking order. I think I still put Montana 2nd. But I have a bit more sympathy for those who argue Elway or Marino over Montana than I did before I took a deep dive on all this, and I think Montana has a ""volume problem"" relative to some other pantheon QBs that doesn't get raised as much as it should be when QB comparison discussions come up.

**TL;DR: Joe Montana was relatively fragile compared to other pantheon QBs even when you account for his era. For those who want to argue Elway or Marino over Montana on an all-time list, durability and availability should be one of their primary arguments. Those who argue Brady, Favre, Rodgers, or Peyton Manning over Montana can and should make the same argument in a somewhat more caveated form, given the difference in eras.**",nfl,El_Producto,58,2019-06-17

League I am in is finally moving to auction drafty style - I am excited but have never participated in one before. I have looked at a few articles discussing auction draft strategies and some tips and tricks to utilize, but most of these articles are geared toward the draft itself, not so much methods of preparing. With snake drafts it was pretty easy to hop into a bunch of mocks to understand where guys were falling as the off season progressed and see how your team would shake out utilizing different strategies and to create rankings to base draft picks off of, but with an auction it seems like preparation should be different. 

What works for you guys? Still check into mocks and hope for decent participation from other members? Create my own values for guys? Just seems really hard to gauge when Saquon could for like 60 bucks or like 85 bucks as opposed to Saquon could be draft first or third overall.

44,Path to the Hall of Fame Wrap Up: All Decade OFfense," I've been doing a series looking at the connection between Annual NFL All Pro Teams and All Decade All Pro Teams. Basically, the All Decade Teams tend to be dominated by the players who made the most individual All Pro teams. Since the same people vote for both awards this makes sense.

 More importantly players who make All Decade teams usually end up in the Hall of Fame. Basically, the players who are locks for the Hall are also locks for the All Decade Teams, but the borderline guys who could go either way really need the All Decade nod in their pocket to keep their dreams of being enshrined in Canton alive. For a lot of players the tight races are incredibly important, and looking over the All Pro Teams to see where those races are was my primary reason for doing this series.

  [Path to the Hall of Fame: Predicting the 2010's NFL All Decade Team Offensive Backfield](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/buzyzk/path_to_the_hall_of_fame_predicting_the_2010s_nfl/)

 **What We Learned: QB's/RB's:** In terms of the Hall not much. The top 4 QB's of the decade were Tom brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees and all four are locks for the Hall of Fame. For RB's Adrian PEterson is an absolute lock for the Hall *and no one else is*. The league has been populated with guys who had great 2-3 year runs or special seasons but the kind of sustained success that ensures serious HoF consideration hasn't really been there.

**What We Learned: WR's:** This one was interesting. Antonio Brown, Calvin Johnson and Julio Jones are all locks for All Decade and on the fast track to Canton. Deandre Hopkins has quietly moved himself into position to join them, and a great 2019 would get him onto the All Decade Team ahead of players like AJ Green and Odell Beckham Jr.. I don't know if many people outside of Texas were looking at Hopkins as a Hall of Famer in the making but if he manages another All Pro season this year maybe they should.

 **What We Learned: O-Line:** Joe Thomas is in for All Decade and the Hall of Fame, no surprise there. For anyone else the road to Canton is going to be tough. Jason Peters and Tyron Smith have a case, but only a borderline one based just on All Pro and Pro Bowl nods (the major O-Line counting stats for Hall voters). All Decade will help them but no guarantees. 

 Jahri Evans Marshall Yanda and Zack Martin have the three best Guard resume's, and an All Decade team will be a major boost for their Hall chances at a position few players make it in. 

 Maurkice Pouncey should make the team at C but he is borderline for the Hall so All Decade might be his best shot at Canton. The race for the other C spot is an interesting one, Alex Mack and Jason Kelce basically need it to have any shot at the Hall, but they will be borderline either way.",nfl,backgrinder,2,2019-06-17

67,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 21)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 21: 1940 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 8-December 8, 1940

Teams: 10

1940 NFL Draft: 200 selections (22 rounds), held in Milwaukee, WI

1940 First Draft Pick: George Cafego, Tailback from the University of Tennessee (Chicago Cardinals)

1940 NFL Championship Game: Chicago Bears (8-3-0) defeated Washington Redskins (9-2-0) 73-0 at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C.

This season featured the following rule changes:

 \-The penalty for a forward pass not from scrimmage is 5 yards.

\-Penalties for fouls that occur prior to a pass or kick from behind the line of scrimmage are enforced from the previous spot. However, penalties for fouls during a free ball or when the offensive team fouls behind their line are enforced from the spot of the foul.

\-Fouls enforced in the field of play cannot penalize the ball more than half the distance to the offender's goal line.

\-If the offensive team commits pass interference in their opponent's end zone, the defense has the choice of 15 yards from the previous spot and a loss of down, or a touchback.

Prior to this season, the Pittsburgh Pirates renamed to the Steelers, meaning 9 of the 10 teams in the league would go by their team name that still carries into today's NFL.

Leading up to the 1940 NFL Championship game, Washington had defeated Chicago 7–3 in a regular season game three weeks earlier in Washington. After the contest, Redskins owner George Preston Marshall told reporters that the Bears were crybabies and quitters when the going got tough. As the Bears prepared for the rematch, Chicago head coach George Halas fired up his team by showing them newspaper articles containing Marshall's comments, then said, ""Gentlemen, this is what George Preston Marshall thinks of you. Well, I think you're a GREAT football team! Now, go out there and prove it!""

Before the game, Halas' friend Clark Shaughnessy, who was concurrently coaching the undefeated Stanford Indians, helped the Bears' game plan. Shaughnessy devised several counters for linebacker shifts that he had noted the Redskins using.

The Bears controlled the game right from the start, using the ""T Formation"" as their primary offensive strategy. On their second play from scrimmage, running back Bill Osmanski ran 68 yards for a touchdown. Washington then marched to the Chicago 26-yard line on their ensuing drive, but wide receiver  Charlie Malone dropped a sure touchdown pass in the end zone that would have tied the game. The field goal attempt on 4th down was missed as well.

Later in the first quarter, Bears quarterback Sid Luckman scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to increase the lead 14–0. On their third drive, Joe Maniaci ran 42 yards for the Bears' third touchdown of the game.

The Bears held a 28–0 halftime lead and then continued to crush the Redskins, scoring 45 points during the second half. After Halas took the team's starters out, the backup players continued to pile on the points. The Bears ended up recording 501 total yards on offense, 382 total rushing yards, and 8 interceptions—returning 3 for touchdowns, all in the third quarter.

As of today, Chicago's 73 points is most in any NFL game, regular season or postseason. The margin of victory is not only the largest-ever in the NFL, but in ANY major American team sport; the closest anyone has come is the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, who demolished the Miami Heat in 1991 by 68 points (148-80). Chicago's seven rushing touchdowns is the second-most touchdowns (by both teams in one game) in league history and the most ever in a postseason game. 

The game was broadcast on radio by Mutual Broadcasting System, the first NFL title game broadcast nationwide.

70,2019 All-Mike Team,"You've got your All-Pro teams. Your All-Analytics teams. Your All-25 and under teams. How about a team thats first criteria isn't play or age, but something that you either have now or never will: the name Mike (or Michael).

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new breed of All-Star NFL team. One where every player regardless of height, weight, skin color, position, salary, intelligence level or ability has something thing in common. His name.

&amp;#x200B;

Name tags aren't necessary here. The only way a player on this team forgets his teammates' name is if he forgets his own.

&amp;#x200B;

The All-Mike team is among the most exclusive in the league. Here are the men who made the cut:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Head Coach: **Mike Tomlin**

This was a tough choice between Mike Tomlin and Mike Zimmer. Both are defensive-minded player coaches with strong personalities. Ultimately, we want the guy with the most head coaching experience. Tomlin has led Pittsburgh for 14 seasons against Zimmer's five in Minnesota. The Steelers have always been a balanced team on offense and defense in Tomlin's time there. Getting all these new faces on the same page will be a feat. Having a coach who's hopefully learned from poor locker room experiences in the past can keep this team from enduring the same fate. Tomlin has the pedigree most of this roster lacks.

&amp;#x200B;

# Offense

&amp;#x200B;

Quarterback: **Mike Glennon**

Let’s start with the bad news. Mike Glennon is the starting quarterback. The shine from his time with the Buccaneers has long wore off as Glennon has been relegated to a career journey-man. It was just two offseasons ago that Chicago gifted Glennon with an astonishing $18.5 million guaranteed for accomplishing next to nothing in his career. That trend of futility continued as he started four games for the Bears which was frankly way too many. If he can somehow regain his rookie form when he threw for 19 touchdowns against 9 picks in 13 games, this team could have the slightest of chances to win a game (or maybe two).

&amp;#x200B;

Running Back: **Mike Davis**

A backfield with Mike Davis leading would *arguably* be the worst in the league. For this team, that’s a ringing endorsement. The Buccaneers (possibly Bills) are just about as bad at running back. However, in the NFL, a star half back isn’t required to get the job done. Just ask Damien Williams in Kansas City. Mike Davis and his 4.6 yards per carry from 2018 will be enough to move the chains semi-consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

Wide Receiver: **Michael Thomas**, **Mike Evans**, **Mike Williams**

This wide receiving corps would easily be the best in the NFL and is this team’s biggest strength. Thomas, Evans and Williams could be dominant enough to trick people into thinking Glennon is an asset again. Each receiver here is individually capable of carrying a passing offense on his shoulders. Thomas proved that in 2018 en route to a First-Team All-Pro bid. His ridiculously reliable hands will be huge for the inaccurate Glennon. Evans and Williams both have massive target windows. They're two of the tallest receivers in the league. If this team is ever able to make it to the red-zone, having Evans and Williams posting up would be tough for any defense to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Tight End: **Mike Gesicki**

Mike Gesicki at tight end provides a player with high upside as a receiving threat to pair with the trio of star wideouts. It might be nice to have a tight end who's more fluent in blocking but we'll work with what we have. Gesicki's elite athleticism could make him a fun toy to develop.

&amp;#x200B;

Left Tackle: **Mike McGlinchey**

The offensive line is the make-or-break position group on this team. If these guys can band together and create support for Glennon in the passing attack and Davis in the rushing attack, there could be a few yards put up on game day. McGlinchey would function well as the left tackle. He stood out in his first year at right tackle for the 49ers. His athleticism would carry over well to the blind side.

&amp;#x200B;

Right Tackle: **Michael Schofield**

Unfortunately, the right end of the line is a completely different story from the left. Michael Schofield is the current right guard for the Los Angeles Chargers. Schofield started at right tackle for the Broncos Super Bowl victory in 2016. Playing on the right side isn't foreign to him. Schofield has the size to handle rushers and the run blocking chops to clear lanes.

&amp;#x200B;

Left Guard: **Mike Iupati**

The guard situation could be much *much* worse. Mike Iupati will be a good asset in the run game. Not so much in pass protection.

&amp;#x200B;

Right Guard: **Mike Person**

Mike Person is actually a very good player. He’d be a starter on just about any real life NFL offensive line. Person is a great piece for paving lanes for Mike Davis and keeping Mike Glennon upright from interior pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

Center: **Mike Pouncey**

Finally, having Mike Pouncey at center really helps shore up this line. He’s an experienced player who’s found a lot of success at the pro level. He’d be a great pivot for this shaky group.

&amp;#x200B;

# Defense

&amp;#x200B;

EDGE: **Michael Bennett**, **Mike Love**

This defensive roster is a bit of a roller coaster ride. First you see Michael Bennett at defensive end. You think “Wow, he’s a guy I’ve heard of before”. It's quite exciting. Then you continue over and see Mike Love. “Who the flip is Mike Love?” Great question. I don’t really have an answer for you other than he’s a person employed by the Buffalo Bills who made five tackles last year. Beggars can’t be choosers. We’ll take him.

&amp;#x200B;

Defensive Interior Linemen: **Michael Pierce**, **Michael Brockers**

Unlike the end spots, the interior defensive line is something to get excited about. Michael Pierce played fairly limited in 2018 for the Ravens with just 37% of snaps but really made his mark. He’ll get plenty of time on the field for us. Let’s hope he wasn’t just a low-volume performer. Unfortunately, reports of him being sent home from Baltimore’s practice for lack of conditioning isn’t exactly comforting. Hopefully the presence of veteran Michael Brockers can point Pierce in the right direction. Brockers has been an ultra reliable starter for the Rams for seven seasons. Having that dependability is a massive plus for this defense. Reserves Mike Pennel and Mike Daniels will be integral in providing a solid rotation at defensive tackle.

&amp;#x200B;

Linebacker: **Mike Hull**, **Mike Tyson**, **Mike Onuoha**

For how integral linebacker is in pulling together a defensive unit, this could be our team’s undoing. The most veteran player at ‘backer is Mike Hull. He has five starts in four years with the Dolphins. Hull has been active in 43 games however, so there could be a bit of leadership there. Maybe. Probably not. The next crack in the foundation at linebacker is Mike Tyson who we’re converting from defensive back/safety to a full-time linebacker. He has the size to handle the position and past experience playing there. Perhaps he could live up to his name and suddenly become a ruthless force in the middle. Lastly, it’s Mike Onuoha of the Ravens. He’s one of two rookies we had to place on this team. Onuoha went undrafted out of Texas A&amp;M-Commerce. He’ll be learning on the fly as a day-one starter.

&amp;#x200B;

Cornerback: **Mike Hilton**, **Mike Hughes**

At cornerback, we’ll have a couple up-and-comers playing out of position. Both Hughes and Hilton are slot corners in reality. Luckily, they’ve shown a lot of promise in their limited years. Mike Hilton is entering his third NFL season and is on the rise. He played 56% of the snaps in 2018 which was the third most for a Steelers corner. At 5’ 9”, he’ll have significant difficulty handling the physicality of the outside cornerback role. But we don’t say no to talent here so Mike Hilton is our CB1. Across from Hilton is sophomore Mike Hughes. Hughes was turning heads in Minnesota before tearing his ACL in week six. He recorded a pick-6 in his short time on the field as a rookie. That playmaking ability is a must for a defense that’s set to get run over. Big plays from small players will drive the competitiveness of this team.

&amp;#x200B;

Safety: **Michael Thomas**, **Mike Edwards**

Rounding out the defense is our two back-end last resorts. Michael Thomas actually made his first Pro Bowl in 2018 from his time with the Giants. It was his first season outside of Miami and went notably well. It’ll be nice to have a proven commodity directing an aggressively young secondary. At the other safety spot is the second rookie on this team. Mike Edwards was a third round pick of the Buccaneers out of Kentucky. He’ll bring some physicality at defensive back and could serve as this team’s return man as well.

&amp;#x200B;

# Special Teams

&amp;#x200B;

Kicker: **Mike Badgley**

It’s refreshing to see some familiar faces again on the special teams unit. Mike Badgley is a starting NFL caliber kicker. He’ll likely be attempting a lot of long-range prayers this season.

&amp;#x200B;

Punter: **Michael Dickson**

Michael Dickson is already a star at punter in the NFL if there ever was one. He made First-Team All-Pro as a rookie. Having an elite punter who’s able to pin offenses back will be infinitely valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

Long Snapper: **Mike Windt**

Last and least, we actually have a long snapper. Mike Windt has been a Charger for all seven of his seasons on an NFL roster. He’s played 16 games each of the last two seasons. At 33, Lindt is the old man of the All-Mike squad.",nfl,claball,102,2019-06-17

83,"Analytics: Top EPA players, broken down by play type","Below is a more detailed explanation, but if you just want to jump to the data, [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jigJo5ljtqwKDqD7gaUrNzMuFNEHcLEBk-vPIvZ7_rs/edit?usp=sharing).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm returning to a focus and breakdown on EPA.  If you are unfamiliar, EPA stands for expected points added.  It represents an estimation of the impact of a given play given the situation, taking into account things like down and distance and field position.  For example, read this great quote from  [https://www.samford.edu/sports-analytics/fans/2018/How-the-EPA-is-Revolutionizing-the-NFL](https://www.samford.edu/sports-analytics/fans/2018/How-the-EPA-is-Revolutionizing-the-NFL):

&gt; ...a team with the ball on the 50-yard line with 3rd down and 5 yards to go may have an EPA of 2.1. On the flip side, a team with 3rd and 5 backed up on their own 5-yard line may have an EPA of(-2.1). If the EPA is negative, this means at the moment the other offense (the team currently on defense) is who we would expect to be the next team to score. A five-yard gain on 3rd and 5 may be a lot more valuable in terms of EPA than a five-yard gain on 1st and 10.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we have that out of the way, let's examine what we've done with the data to arrive at this fine chart.  First, we isolated each players EPA by category: passing, rushing and receiving.  Next, for fairness, we averaged this over a per game played.  Finally, I filtered out anybody who had 3 or less games played.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, some personal observations:

* Philip Rivers and Andrew Luck are the only top rated QBs that had negative rushing contribution.  This means that when they ran the ball they tended to make it less likely to score points.
* Drew Brees, a name that does not bring the word ""scramble"" to my mind, ran the ball very effectively.  In fact, he ran it *just as effectively as Patrick Mahomes!*
* Mitch Trubisky ran the ball just as effectively as Gurley... tied for 1st overall in the league at 2.8 epa/game.  In fact, 41% of his overall epa came from running the ball.  That is just ahead of Aaron Rodgers (37%) and just behind Nick Foles (45%).
* Also, holy crap Nick Foles!  Among QBs with a positive passing EPA, he is the only QB that comes close to being more effective running the ball than passing.
* RBs seem to have an overall low EPA.  I don't think this is necessarily their fault, as there are a number of things stacked against them.    
First, it is my unsubstantiated (as of yet) claim that running plays tend to be less explosive on average than passing plays, so this limits their upside (or at least the frequency of their upside).  Second, teams may revert to the run in situations where they are settling/setting up for a field goal, milking the clock, playing it safe, etc. and this will also have a downward pressure on EPA.  Finally, another unsubstantiated claim that the ball tends to be run more in situations where ""success"" doesn't necessarily inflate EPA all that much.  I'm thinking 3rd and short or Goal to go situations.  Hey, if you score on 1st and Goal from the 1 on a run play, you went from almost certainly scoring to guaranteed scoring, so not much positive EPA.    
Overall what I'm saying is that ball carriers tend to get the shaft in this rating.  Therefore, compare RBs against one another and not against other player positions.

96,From Rodgers to Montana: the Worst 3 game playoff scoring stretches for pantheon QBs,"In another thread there was mention of how Joe Montana struggled against the Giants in the playoffs, which led me to note that Montana had a really rough playoff stretch from '85 to '87, which in turn led me to wonder just how bad the worst three game playoff stretches were for other pantheon QBs.

This should be viewed as trivia. To the extent there's a point here it's that Montana's '85-'87 playoff run was an unusually rough 3 game sequence for a QB of his caliber.

I'm just picking 3 game playoff start sequences by fewest offensive points scored, though in many cases these do seem to legitimately be at least in the conversation for the worst 3 game playoff stretches of these QBs' respective careers.

The 3 game window is completely arbitrary, and was, in a sense, cherrypicked to be disadvantageous to Joe Montana. I included Ben Roethlisberger, even though he's not quite a ""pantheon"" guy, as I thought Steelers fans would want to know where he fell.

This was all done by hand so always possible I got something wrong. ""Years"" refer to the corresponding regular season years, not the years the playoff games were actually in.

If anyone wants to steal these numbers for another thread and flesh them out (with, say, passing yards, TDs, INTs) please feel free.

If anyone wants to 

This is my second thread today that is a bit negative re: Montana. It does reflect that I've been taking a close look at Joe of late but I promise it isn't personal. Though I totally understand if any 49ers fans [have a Steve Rodgers response.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/46/f5/3c46f578d1610808118c4062b8908d3b.gif) On the bright side, this thread should make for some happy Packers fans.

FN: Steve Young and Tom Brady would have different 3 game sequences as their worst except a) in both cases the QB left with an injury before halftime in one game, so it seemed a bit odd to count them, and b) in Brady's case I'd also be picking a set of games (the '01 playoffs) where he went 3-0 and won the SB.",nfl,El_Producto,31,2019-06-17
97,Brady should take more blame for the game ending strip sack in Super Bowl 52.,"Brady is my favorite player, I think he is the GOAT, but I think he has been getting a pass on this play. Maybe I’m being too critical, but he choked on this one play.

2:16 left, 1 timeout, on the 33 yard line, with plenty of time facing a 2nd and 2. You’ve been moving the ball at will all game too, so no need to take shots down field. James White goes into the flat, completely uncovered and wide open for the first down. Nearest guy was 5 yards away. The dump off is a first down, most likely stops the clock too since he can dip out of bounds. You get a new first and still in the game.

Brady knows he is going to be opened based off the defense alone. Instead, he looks for the bigger play down field, steps up in the pocket, realizes nothing is there and turns to settle for the dump off. But, too late, strip sack, game effectively over.

Over the next month, I’m going to be unveiling the best team of all time comprised solely of players drafted at that spot. We’re going to determine which draft pick, historically speaking, could yield the best team. The criteria for who I can and cannot put on that team is listed in the introductory post; remember that if a great player from the 1960s is not on this list, odds are that he got drafted twice (once by the NFL and once by the AFL) and I put him on another team that needed him more.

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the #1 team of all time comprised solely of #26 picks.

**WR** | **Calvin Ridley** | **2018** | Though Ridley has only spent one season in the league thus far, he warrants a spot on this list because of his great rookie campaign. In 2018, Ridley had 64 receptions for 821 yards and 10 touchdowns, and finished sixth in the NFL last season in receiving touchdowns. | Alexander Wright
**TE** | **Billy Traux** | **1964** | Traux spent 10 seasons in the NFL, including the 1971 season with the Cowboys when he won Super Bowl VI. He finished his career with 199 receptions for 2,458 yards and 17 touchdowns, and had his best season in 1969 with the Rams, when he had 37 receptions for 431 yards and five touchdowns. | Bob Windsor
**OT** | **Duane Brown** | **2008** | In Brown’s 11-year career in the NFL thus far, he’s started 158 games, and has made the Pro Bowl four times, including three straight seasons with the Texans from 2012-2014. Additionally, Brown was named a Second Team All Pro twice, getting this honor in 2011 and 2018. | N/A
**OT** | **Don Mosebar** | **1983** | Mosebar primarily played at center, but in 1988, he played left tackle for the Raiders, so it counts. He spent his entire 12-year career with the Raiders, starting 156 games (including every game from 1990-1994), and won Super Bowl XVIII with the Raiders as well. Mosebar made three Pro Bowls, making the Pro Bowl in 1986, 1990, and 1991. | Dave Foley

**DE** | **Robert Porcher** | **1992** | In Porcher’s 12-year career, all with the Lions, he started 158 games and recorded 95.5 sacks.

Additionally, Porcher made it to three Pro Bowls, receiving this honor in 1997, 1999, and 2001. | N/A
**DE** | **Whitney Mercilus** | **2012** | Though primarily listed as a linebacker, Mercilus was listed as a defensive end for parts of the 2015 season, so it counts. In his seven-year career thus far with the Texans, he’s started 73 games and has recorded 42.5 sacks. Mercilus’ best season came in 2016, when he was named a Second Team All Pro; he also recorded 12 sacks during the 2015 season, which was the sixth most in the league that year. | Anthony Spencer

**S** | **Dave Brown** | **1975** | Though Brown was primarily listed at cornerback, he played safety with the Seahawks in 1976, so it counts.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses**

**Strengths:** The offensive line is loaded. The weak spot on the interior of the line is Kent Hill, a five-time Pro Bowler; the other two guys on the interior are a Hall of Famer and a guy that is destined for Canton at any minute (if Faneca doesn’t get in sometime in the next few years, then I have no idea what the Committee is doing). Everyone on the offensive line has made it to at least three Pro Bowls, and the five offensive linemen together have combined for 27 Pro Bowls (an average of over five Pro Bowls per player). Additionally, the linebackers are incredible. Anderson is a member of an all-decade team, Matthews might become a member of an all-decade team, and Lewis is arguably the greatest middle linebacker to ever play the game. Good luck finding a better unit than that one.

**Weaknesses:** The receivers are pretty poor. Kutner is fine enough, as he was solid for his era, but anytime a rookie goes on there, it’s troublesome. The other options to replace Ridley were Alexander Wright (his best season came in 1993 with the Raiders when he had 27 receptions for 462 yards and four touchdowns), Breshad Perriman, Randy Burke, and Jonathan Baldwin. Essentially, Ridley is there by default. While Harbaugh’s not a bad quarterback by any means (especially compared to some of the other quarterbacks in this competition), is he going to be able to succeed with that group of guys to throw to?

**/r/NFL Poll Question of the Day**

 You guys are eventually going to vote on the bracket and which team advances in each round. However, to get you guys engaged during this month-long process when I’m going through the teams, I’m going to do a simple Strawpoll question a day regarding the roster makeup of the team in question. Because today’s post is about the team of #26 draft picks, today’s question will be about the offensive line controversy on this team.

**This offensive line is stacked with Pro Bowlers left and right. There are four players on the offensive line who are not in the Hall of Fame. Those players are Duane Brown, Alan Faneca, Kent Hill, and Don Mosebar. Who is the weakest link of the group?**

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18185515)**

---

**Final Thoughts**

For a team comprised of #26 draft picks, this doesn’t look too bad. The halfbacks aren’t anything to write home about, the receivers are pretty bad, the quarterback situation could be better, and there are some weaker links on the defensive line and the secondary. But where this team is stacked, it’s a sight to behold. An offensive line with 27 Pro Bowl appearances plus a linebacker unit with two all-decade players, including Ray Lewis, and possibly three if Matthews makes the All-2010s Team, is going to be a relatively tough out. We’ll see if this team can pull off an upset when the time comes.

We’ll do the team of #27 picks tomorrow at 9:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day at 9:00 ET for the next team’s roster.

174,What is a Weird Fact About The NFL That Most People Don't Realize?,"For instance, I came up with a some weird facts today that are easy to look up, but most people don't realize.

-The AFC South is the only division with only *one* Super Bowl Winner: Indianapolis Colts.

-The NFC South only has two NFL Championship Titles won in their entire division(pre-Super Bowl, and Super Bowl combined). For a comparison, the NFC North has 27 combined titles, the NFC East has 22 combined titles, and even the AFC South has 6 combined titles. What makes this odd, is they have still produced two Super Bowl winners.

-On the above note, the two NFC South Championship Titles have came in a seven year span: The Buccaneers' Super Bowl win in the 2002-2003 season, and the Saints' Super Bowl win in the 2009-2010 season. 

-The Bills are still the only team to make the Super Bowl four years in a row. Really, this is a remarkable feat, but it's overshadowed because they lost all four of them.

-There are only five NFL teams which haven't won any NFL Championship Titles in their history(pre-Super Bowl, or Super Bowl era). Those five teams are the Bengals, Falcons, Jaguars, Texans, and Panthers. 

-George Blanda is the oldest person to ever play in the NFL, at 48 years old.",nfl,Kylechunli,25,2019-06-18

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.
   

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

|AFC|NFC|
:--|:--|:--|
|Ravens|Cardinals|
|Bills|~~Falcons~~|
|Bengals|~~Panthers~~|
|Browns|Bears|
|Broncos|~~Cowboys~~|
|Texans|Lions|
|Colts|~~Packers~~|
|~~Jaguars~~|~~Vikings~~|
|Chiefs|Saints|
|Dolphins|Giants|
|Chargers|Eagles|
|Jets|Rams|
|Raiders|49ers|
|~~Steelers~~|Seahawks|
|Titans|Buccaneers|
|~~Patriots~~|Redskins|


&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  
If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/CoalitionAgainstBirds, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS.)
Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users.
(Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)  

   

The team with the most votes will be the team that's voted out. This will go on for 30 rounds until there are 3 teams remaining. On the 30th round (the Final Tribal Council), users will then decide the winner of Survivor out of the 3 remaining teams.

I really think this particular play changed the outcome of the game and gave the chargers the chance to win. Also showed how James was an all pro as a rookie and might have been the steal of the draft. There’s also several plays that Barkley made that could have qualified but I feel like he rightfully has gotten the credit he deserves. What do you guys think?,nfl,MeatyClangars,43,2019-06-18

Personally I would steal Zach Ertz Lord knows witten isn’t what he used to be and Our Other TE’s are below average at best. 

I debated Fletcher Cox but I feel like Cowboys could use more help at TE than at DL. 


Plus it would be nice to not have to deal with Ertz torching our Safeties and other safeties around the league for the eagles. 


Personally I think this would help the cowboys the most in this coming offseason.

220,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 22)","To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 22: 1941 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 7-December 7, 1941

Teams: 10

1941 NFL Draft: 204 selections (22 rounds), held in Washington, D.C.

1941 First Draft Pick: Tom Harmon, Halfback from the University of Michigan (Chicago Bears)

1941 NFL Championship Game: Chicago Bears (10-1-0) defeated New York Giants (8-3-0) 37-9 at Wrigley Field in Chicago, IL.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The penalty for illegal shift is 5 yards.

\-The penalty for illegal kick or bat is 15 yards.

\-Whenever a player is ejected from the game, his team is penalized 15 yards.

\-A personal foul committed by the opponent of the scoring team is enforced on the ensuing kickoff.

In addition to those rule changes, this was the first season  that the league commissioner became involved in enforcement of player conduct standards. Commissioner Elmer Layden in August assessed $25 fines on Packers quarterback Larry Craig and Giants halfback Hank Soar for fighting.

This season also is notable for using ""Wilson"" as the official game ball of the NFL.

In the Eastern Division, the Redskins held a half-game after nine weeks of play; at 5–1–0, their only loss had been 17–10 to the 5–2-0 Giants, who had lost two games in a row. Washington, however, lost its next three games, while the Giants rebounded to win their next two games. On November 23, the 5–3 Redskins met 7–2 New York at the Polo Grounds, and the Giants' 20–13 win clinched the division championship.

The Western Division race was one between the Bears and Packers. By November 2, when the teams met at Wrigley Field, the Bears were 5–0 and the Packers 6–1, in part because of the Bears' earlier 25–17 win at Green Bay. Green Bay's 16–14 win put them in the lead, and they finished the regular season at 10–1 on November 30 with a 22–17 comeback win at Washington. On the afternoon of December 7, 1941, the day more famously known for the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Bears were losing to the Cardinals, 14–0, and trailed 24–20 in the fourth quarter, before rallying for a 34–24 win. Both teams finished at 10–1 and a playoff was set to determine who would go to the title game. With the United States now embroiled in World War II, the Bears and Packers met at Wrigley Field on December 14, with Chicago winning 33–14.

In the build-up to the championship game, both the Bears and Giants were appearing for the 5th time in this game, both owning 2 victories. This was also their 3rd time facing off in the NFL Championship game, with the home team winning in both prior meetings.

In the 1941 NFL Championship game,  the hometown Bears kicked three field goals in the first half to lead 9–6 at the intermission. The Giants took the opening drive of the second half down to the five, but settled for a short field goal to tie the score. Chicago dominated the rest of the second half with four unanswered touchdowns and won 37–9. 

Two players in the game, back Young Bussey of the Bears and end Jack Lummus of the Giants, were killed in action three years later in World War II, in early 1945. Navy Lieutenant Bussey died in the Invasion of the Lingayen Gulf in the Philippines and Marin Lieutenant Lummus was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for valor at the Battle of Iwo Jima.

To me, the big news here is the Watch Around The World - the only pain point I have with my setup is that sometimes the trans-Atlantic connections are not as fast as I would like and it gets tough to stream multiple games at once. If I can use my Portugese account on a VPN though Mexico, that would be very nice for me.

225,The Case for Matt Forte as a Hall of Fame RB,"TLDR: Matt Forte was an exceptional 3-down back  who produced at a hall of fame level throughout an underrated career

Matt Forte played for ten seasons in the NFL (2008-2015 CHI), (2016-2017 NYJ) and stayed a pretty low profile star throughout his career. Often stuck on hapless Bears and Jets rosters, he failed to garner national attention outside of fantasy football owners, despite efficiently producing at an all-time level. 

Some stats (courtesy of Pro football reference)

In 10 years:
14,468 scrimmage yards, 19th all time among RBs
Of the RBs ahead of him 15 are in Canton or sure fire locks (like Adrian Peterson)

Of this list of hall of famers and legendary RBs ahead of him in scrimmage yards, only five advanced farther than Matt Forte's 5.0 yards per touch:
 Jim Brown (5.65y/t),
Adrian Peterson (5.02y/t)
Tiki Barber (5.58y/t)
Marshal Faulk (5.32y/t)
Barry Sanders (5.32y/t)

Not only was Forte efficient, he was prolific, boasting 1000+ scrimmage yards in 9 of his 10 seasons, all except for his injury-shortened final season
Furthermore, Forte dominated the league to 1400+ scrimmage yards in 7 of his 10 seasons, only 8 backs in league history have achieved that feat and all but one are in the hall (Ricky Watters)

Matt Forte sustained an average of 20 touches per game at 5.0 yards per touch for a clean 100 yards per game average (technically is 99 ypg).
All totaled he had 554 receptions, good for 5th all time at running back and another 2,356 carries... yet he only fumbled 22 times on his career

That is only one fumble every 132.27 touches, to put into perspective how impressive that number is, here are some other elite backs' totals

Adrian Peterson: one fumble per 68.82 touches
Edgerrin James: one fumble per 78.66 touches
Barry Sanders: one fumble per 83.27 touches
Ladianian Tomlinson: one fumble per 126.6 touch
Marshall Faulk: one fumble per 100.08 touches
Walter Payton: one per 50.35 touches

The only back as prolific as Matt Forte who fumbled less frequently was Curtis Martin, one fumble per 138.0 touches

Matt Forte was the engine behind every offense he was part of, efficiently chipping in yards on the ground and through the air. Unfortunately during his career he didn't get much support on either offense or defense. He only played with 10 other pro bowlers during his career",nfl,delete_thehumanoid,69,2019-06-18

243,Analyzing Player Value through Win Percentage,"**Introduction**


Within the NFL season, there are many games which become non-competitive. During these games, superior players can pad their stats against opponents who have given up, or inferior players can boost their numbers against a team that doesn’t care.


In order to quantify a player’s performance when how they played mattered, we can look at how much each player affected his team’s winning percentage when he was involved in a play. This should weigh players positively when they made strong contributions during high leverage situations, while adding almost no weight when the stakes were lower.


By iterating through the entire 2018-2019 season, we can rank players based on how the plays they were involved in affected the outcome of games they played. For QBs, we can also see the top 10 games by this metric. This should help quantify meaning behind players’ numbers, though it does suffer from a few drawbacks, namely game script (particularly for running backs). As with any metric, this must be taken with your own knowledge to form a better picture.


I calculated the sum of their percentages as well as their medians. The medians you see are normalized relative to the position average. A player with a large discrepancy between their median and sum means that they may have had games where they contributed a very large positive or negative effect to their team’s result. Medians help see who played well while mostly ignoring these outlier performances.

Running backs were probably the most interesting group for this. Clearly, receiving backs are considered more valuable than guys who mainly run. This is pretty much because running in most cases is considered a negative. Perhaps most importantly is the dependence on game script. A 12-yard rush in a situation where a team overwhelmingly should have passed gives a running back a negative contribution, even though they performed well. You can see this with a guy like Saquon Barkley, whose team was down so often that pretty much every time he ran it was considered a bad call to get back into the game. Additionally, a guy like Zeke who is the focal point of his team’s offense is under-represented. Zeke held 3 of the 10 highest graded games, yet because he was either dominant or neutralized he didn’t receive a fantastic grade.


*WR Rankings*

https://i.imgur.com/NCVdQom.png


For WRs, since boom/bust players are more valuable, I ranked them by their median multiplied by their sum. 



**The Program**


There is a ton of data my program generates which I didn’t end up using, and there’s a bunch of other stuff you can do with it.


It can look at win percentage data back to 2016, so you can compare performance in previous years to this, it can look at how players add winning percentage when going to the left/right/center of the field, and it can also look at defensive players. It’s a great tool to let you do all sorts of analysis for free.


The program also contains the tools you can use to get different sorts of data I ignored. Just looking at how ESPN formats it’s snap-by-snap data can give you a ton of insight. If you want to download it and mess around, the files are here:

I’d highly recommend just having a look. If you change anything and find interesting stuff, please let me know.

Ever since becoming the Chargers starting QB in 2006, Philip Rivers quickly staked his claim as part of the upper echelon of current NFL QBs. Rivers has shown year in and year out that his football acumen and leadership ability deserve to be mentioned among the game’s best, and I could write a whole essay on how good that stuff has been throughout his career. The point of this blurb, however, is to capture the essence of what made Philip Rivers a Top 100 player for just the 2018 season. So…what got him on the list? 

There isn’t really a big moment or game that best exemplifies how impressive Rivers was in 2018 (several of the Chargers’ best games this season had pedestrian passing numbers). The best word to describe how good Rivers was this past season is efficiency. His 68.3% completion percentage in 2018 is the second-highest percentage he’s had in his career (69.5% in 2013). Among all NFL QBs in 2018, Rivers consistently finished in the top 5 in multiple categories involving average yards gained per pass attempt, net yards gained per pass attempt and yards per completion. It also should be said that, even with the litany of weapons Rivers had at his disposal (Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Tyrell Williams, Melvin Gordon, Austin Ekeler), he managed to be as efficient as he was without the most likely player to aid in that aspect – TE Hunter Henry did not play in the regular season due to an ACL tear he sustained during OTAs. 

As the Chargers continue to move towards a more balanced offensive attack, there has been some reduction in Rivers’ direct involvement in the Chargers offense (the number of passing attempts Rivers had in 2018 – 508 – is his lowest number of pass attempts in a season since 2009, which was LaDainian Tomlinson’s final year as Chargers RB). But that in and of itself is a big reason why Rivers was a top player in 2018. Not only did he take advantage of the opportunities he had, but it can also be implied that his presence itself forced defenses to account for what he can do through the air. Rivers will enter his 14th season as the starting QB for the Chargers in 2019 and if 2018 is any indication, he will continue to be the biggest weapon on the very potent Chargers offense.

#\#49 – Matt Ryan – Quarterback – Atlanta Falcons [](/ATL)

In 2016, Matt Ryan was the league's MVP and offensive player of the year. That year he led a historically great offense and was recognized for it. In the 2016 version of the /r/nfl top 100 players list Matt Ryan was the #4 ranked player. Let's compare his 2016 and 2018 seasons.

Stat|2016|2018
:--:|:--:|:--:
Yards|4,944|4,924
Comp. %|69.9%|69.4%
TD’s|38|35
INT|7|7
Team record|11-5|7-9

Strikingly similar stats yet in 2018 Matt Ryan was not even named to the Pro Bowl roster. The big difference between the seasons is of course the performance of his Atlanta Falcons. Ryan’s 2018 season will likely be forgotten because of how poorly the team performed (mainly due to injuries plaguing the defense), but the stats are eerily similar to his MVP year. It certainly wasn’t Matt Ryan holding the Falcons back. His 2018 passer rating is the highest in NFL history for a QB with a losing record, and 24th best regardless of record.

If Matt Ryan can keep up his 2018 form and the Falcons can return defensive stars Deion Jones, Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen (who all missed most of 2018) then the Falcons may be poised to make a return as a serious contender in the NFC.

#\#48 – Kenny Clark – Interior Defensive Line (34) – Green Bay Packers [](/GB)

Before discussing the stats, here is a TL;DR: Kenny Clark is a God at [pass rushing](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1049745257779220481), [run stopping](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1062173247704305664), and [affecting the play through a double team](https://twitter.com/SconnieSports/status/1065439183072882688). Now, on to the stats:

Kenny Clark is an absolute monster who dominates the field of play. Your typical NT will play a limited snap count.  Damon Harrison played 56.6% of his team's snaps, Linval Joseph 69.1%, Brandon Williams 51.0%, etc. Not Kenny fucking Clark.  Playing 82.7% of his defensive snaps, the only nominated DL with more snaps was Aaron Donald. That's it. What a stud.

Clark had the 5th most run stops among interior defenders behind Hicks, Damon, Guy, and Donald. Looking at run stop%  and adjusting for snap count, Clark was still 6th among those nominated. Additionally, Clark was 5th in PFF run defense grade, enough for 4th place. And to top it all off, he ranked 6th in tackling efficiency, ahead of Hicks (barely), and Donald and Casey (comfortably).  Overall, he was a top 5 run defender among all of the nominations. And as a reminder, he played a much higher percentage of snaps than Snacks, and noticeably more than Casey and Hicks, while still maintaining this efficiency.

[Though Kenny Clark's coverage ability is definitely elite,](https://twitter.com/zachkruse2/status/1062053617534951425?s=19) he usually sticks to getting to the QB on passing downs. Because they spend \~50% of their snaps at 0-1 tech, NTs often make poor pass rush contributions. Not Kenny fucking Clark. Statistically, Kenny Clark is 8th in PFF's pass rush productivity among interior D-linemen.  That's above Rankins, Casey, Hicks, and more. Not in love yet? He graded out as PFF's **4th best pass rusher in the entire NFL**, behind only Donald, Cox, and Chris Jones.  What in the fuck. An NT, one of the few true ones left, was PFF's 4th best pass rusher behind 3 historic seasons in their own manner. He was a top 5 pass rusher in addition to being a top 5 run defender.?

So overall we have a player who was beyond stellar for the amount he played, only exceeded by Aaron Donald among all interior D-lineman. He was a top 5 run defender and pass rusher among interior D-linemen, an honor I'd only give to Aaron Donald and Fletcher Cox otherwise. And he did it as a versatile NT that can move anywhere on the interior D-line.  He was a fucking beast statistically, in every way, while playing with a high responsibility in their defense, in a hard situation.

There was an interior defensive lineman who broke two NFL sack records last season. The first? Most consecutive games in a season with a sack, and that number was 11. The second? Most consecutive games in NFL history with a sack, and that number was 11. Who was it you ask? Well, the title obviously gives it away, but it’s not one of those other heavy hitters from 2018. It was none other than Chris Jones.

He was one of the few bright spots on the Chiefs defense last year that, as a whole, was pretty bad. However, there were times, many times, throughout the year where the Chiefs offense would do their thing and allow the Chiefs defense to unleash their pass rush. And unleash they did. Jones was an elite pass rusher in 2018 to say the least. From game 5 till game 15, Jones recorded at least one sack in each and every game. More impressively was his versatility in doing so. [He could beat linemen with his quick feet and amazing hands at the expense of Andy Dalton](https://imgur.com/a/4lVonNn). Not even an obvious hold there could stop him. [Other times, he'd line up as the edge and use that speed to stunt inside at the expense of Case Keenum](https://imgur.com/a/2SxqWIW). And just in case you’re getting the impression he relies mainly on speed, [think again](https://imgur.com/a/WYcR7p9). As we know, sacks aren’t everything. Pressures and QB hits matter. Doing so can even sometimes be better if it forces a bad throw, like [this one that is picked more often than not](https://imgur.com/a/StfB8nq) or [this one that was very similar, except it actually was picked off](https://imgur.com/a/OwfagVu).

Pass rushing was his forte. He was elite at it and shows no signs of stopping. But let’s not kid ourselves here. He can do some other things too, even though he might not be as elite at them as he is pass rushing. Cincinnati found that out when they [tried a little sweep that was blown up in the backfield](https://imgur.com/a/fDdnzYP). Joel Bitonio, another one of our top 100 players, [found out that Jones can make you look silly on a running play too](https://imgur.com/a/DpYxcIx). In a game largely void of defense (yes that certain Monday Night Game) aside from a few great plays, Jones provided one of the more impressive defensive plays you’ll see on a play in which the Chiefs gave up a five yard rush. [As we see here](https://imgur.com/a/o3XcbbM), Jones completely gets rid of his blocker within a half second. He then uses his speed to move over and close a gap that wasn’t even his responsibility, preventing a potential touchdown and negating it to a five yard gain. That play was one of those little things that won’t show up anywhere on the stat sheet aside from a tackle, but it was huge.

No doubt about it, Chris Jones was elite in 2018, and he deserves every bit of his number 47 ranking here on this list. The future is bright for Jones, and with him already being an elite and versatile pass rusher at his age, the AFC West QBs not named Mahomes are very likely going to be face to face with this guy for many years to come.

The 29 year-old Akiem Hicks just posted his best season of his career. A fan favorite and literal fucking bear, Hicks’ presence on the defensive line is one topped by only he league’s best interior linemen. Known for his fearless, blood thirsty motor, Hicks wants to win - always. His run stopping is among the league’s best, finishing with 44 total run stops and posting a PFF run grade of 92.8. And he’s not exactly a slouch in pass defense either, generating 51 pressures and 8 sacks on the year and 5 pass deflections from the interior, he was the perfect complement to Khalil Mack and Eddie Goldman on the defensive line.


Simply put, Hicks is a playmaker and an absolute beast. His complete versatility is hard to come by in this league, as he is without any major flaws in his game, and that extends into who he is as a person. Hicks has solidified himself as a leader for this young Bears team, and his easy-going, always smiling personality is infectious. [Hicks can seamlessly turn from laughing about nothing]( https://youtu.be/ihbEebzAt-0?t=312) to [destroying your soul]( https://youtu.be/ihbEebzAt-0?t=340). He’s never going to turn down an opportunity to help his team, be it either with his [relentless drive]( https://youtu.be/ho0MYOxa7yk?t=59) or with his top tier [rushing abilities]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1XM_jsADeo).

Akiem Hicks is the whole package. There were games this year where Hicks was the best player on a defense with three First Team All-Pros on it. Hell, he was the best player period against the Rams, a game featuring Aaron Donald in the best year of his career. There is nothing to dislike about Hicks’ game, whether it’s from the perspective of him as a person, as a player, or as a Literal Fucking Bear, and he more than deserves his spot on this list.

Twenty three. I don’t need to tell you what this number means to the city of Chicago. If you wear this number, there is going to be a certain weight to how people perceive your play. For the years of his career up to this point, Kyle Fuller was met with a lot of doubts from the fanbase. His fifth year option was declined. After a very promising and flat-out great year in 2017, Fuller re-inspired hope and got a hefty deal. Many were worried he’d take a step back after his “Prove It” year as Packers fans proudly claimed that they forced the Bears to overpay for Fuller. At this point, though, it is very clear that Kyle is one seriously good player. 


In the 2018 season, Kyle Fuller led one of, if not the best, cornerback units in the league. While Fuller did not shadow receivers to the extent of some other top cornerbacks in the league, he consistently allowed his defense stability on the outside, making a massive leap in his [playmaking]( https://giant.gfycat.com/BareRevolvingAmazondolphin.webm). Many fans will remember his dropped interception week 1 against the Packers, but that moment is incredibly misleading for his season performance, as Kyle would go on to lead the league in [interceptions and passes defended]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqpCmqY0-wk), with [7]( https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DarkBrilliantArabianwildcat-size_restricted.gif) and 21 respectively. Fuller was the best corner on the best secondary in the league. While he was surrounded with great talent in the rest of the secondary, Fuller’s impact on the secondary is irreplaceable. His physical reliability, having never missed a game in his career, and consistently great coverage, posting a 66.6 passer rating against last season, has given the Bears a [franchise cornerstone in their secondary]( https://media2.giphy.com/media/9A4YjhimT9ngO3R8Tq/giphy.gif). Ultimately, Kyle Fuller’s 2018 campaign solidified his role as a leader, Pro Bowler, great fucking player, and First Team All-Pro, more than earning his spot on this list.

Kevin Byard's play in 2018 has entered his name into the upper echelon of the next generation of safeties. As he enters his 4th year in the league, Kevin Byard will be looking to set the market for safeties for years to come, following the ludicrous contract that All Star Safety Landon Collins received just a couple months ago. 

Kevin Byard came into the 2018 season following an 8 Int total season. He did not disappoint as he arguably looked better, more sharp and improved his run tackle defense from the season before. Despite only tallying 4 Interceptions total this year, he led the Titans secondary into being a top 10 unit that allowed only 216.9 yards per game, good for 6th in the league. Which is up from 2017's 25th ranked 239.2 yards per game. Kevin's game has improved steadily since he entered the league in all areas. He has become an excellent man to man coverage safety, plays his zone splendidly, and has improved his open field tackling skills to become a true safety. Kevin is physical enough to line him up in the box, fast enough to shadow his receivers 1 on 1, and smart enough to cover any half of the field at any given moment.

In a new era where great safeties are coming out of the woodwroks like Eddie Jackson, Harrison Smith, Derwin James and Jamal Adams, it is in my belief that Kevin will force himself into every ""top 5 safety"" conversation that football pundits will hold in the coming years. In case you are not convinced, [here](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-the-rise-of-kevin-byard-one-of-the-leagues-brightest-young-stars) is a Pro Football Focus article detailing Kevin's impressive 2018 season

Rodney Hudson has long been one of the best Centers in the NFL and is finally getting well-deserved recognition on this list coming in at 43. He has been the model of consistency in run and especially in pass protection in his time with the Raiders. Per PFF in 2018, Hudson surrendered 0 sacks and 5 pressures allowing a pressure on 0.82% of his pass blocking snaps - or 1 pressure for every 121.8 pass blocking snaps. Both figures are number 1 in the NFL. He finished 2018 like he finished 2017, 2016, and 2015: the best pass blocking center in the NFL. He's also one of the smartest players at the position in the leagues [helping set up proper protection pre-snap against top competition](https://twitter.com/ChrisReed_NFL/status/1040997010277511168). Hudson is also a good run blocker while capable of pulling and blocking in space. He's also not one to [shy away from any contact whatsoever.](https://twitter.com/GipsySafety/status/1069403192545423361)  
  
Hudson has been a consistent All Pro caliber Center the last few years with the Raiders. While this list is about 2018 only, it's worth noting Hudson's career with the Raiders to date:  
  
*Over his entire eight-year career, Hudson has allowed just nine sacks, eight hits and 35 hurries from his 3711 pass-blocking snaps. To put those numbers into perspective, two starting centers in the NFL (Mason Cole and John Sullivan) respectively allowed 35 and 37 total pressures in 2018 alone. All told, Hudson’s career pressure percentage of 1.40%, his career pass-blocking efficiency of 99.2, his average of 71.4 pass blocks played per pressure allowed and his 94.8 pass-blocking grade all rank first among centers in the PFF era (2006-present) with at least 750 pass-blocking snaps.* - [Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-raiders-c-rodney-hudson-continues-to-shine-in-pass-protection). This same source also cites Hudson as allowing 1 pressure for every 151.0 pass blocking snaps since 2017 and a grand total of 0.7% pressure rate. Just an astonishing feat for the beloved member of the Raiders roster.  
  
2018 wasn't just a great season for Hudson; it was a *normal* season for Hudson. He’s the foundation of the Raiders offensive line and one of the team leaders. His ability and leadership are everything you look for in a player.

The 2011 draft class produced two of this generation’s best corners: Patrick Peterson and Richard Sherman. However, an argument can be made that the best corner of this class wasn’t even drafted. He wasn’t even a high-priority UDFA. He was the 90th man on the 90-man roster and had no expectations to ever amount to anything. Yet, despite coming from nothing, Chris Harris Jr. has firmly established himself as one of the best and most consistent players at his position. [Besides his rookie year and 2017, Harris has graded out as a top 10 corner each year]( https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-3.32.39-PM-768x430.png)—including four top 5 selections. 

2018 was no exception. Despite playing in a career low 12 games, Chris Harris dominated the competition year-round. He [graded out as one of the best slot corners]( https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-broncos-cb-chris-harris-jr-continues-to-dominate-from-the-slot-as-one-of-the-leagues-premier-corners) in the NFL—a title he’s claimed dating back to 2012. Against an explosive Chiefs offense, Harris only gave up six yards on one target. Patrick Mahomes learned quickly after Week 4—when he threw at Harris 8 times for only 47 yards—that targeting Harris will result in a wasted down. Harris had game changing turnovers, especially this [beauty against the Steelers]( https://youtu.be/sbvrwo-2IIs?t=415). Harris was on his way to another legendary season.

Sadly, he broke his ankle against the Bengals and would miss the remainder of the Broncos season. They were 6-6 and having a fringe playoff chance when he got hurt, but the Broncos lost their four remaining games without Harris and fell to 6-10. He could’ve returned for the playoffs, which would’ve been a legendary feat, but that wasn’t meant to be. Nonetheless, with an adjusted contract in hand and an injury him, Mr. Consistency can close out the decade with another great season.

#\#41 – Marshal Yanda – Offensive Guard – Offensive Guard [](/BAL)

[Player Profile Card]()



**Written By:** */u/jiggs_* [](/BUF)   
  
  
And for the 5th time on this list, we have Marshal Yanda. This has only been going on for 7 years, and Yanda has been a staple for just about every year it has been running. Yanda [still has the strength to drive players off the line](https://twitter.com/VeteranScout/status/1040982792828444672?s=19), [still has the footwork and hand strength to stay in control against top-tier pass rushers](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1137057908129259521?s=19), and [still has the quickness to trick a pass rusher, pull to the outside, and still make it to the block in time to seal the edge on the screen] (https://twitter.com/VeteranScout/status/1040986711696662528?s=19). So now that you can see first hand that the strength and quickness are still there,  it's obvious that Yanda would once again be high on the list. His mental game has not stagnated, and he is still not only fighting to beat you on the field, but also in your own head. He makes you remember him. [Watch here](https://twitter.com/BrandonThornNFL/status/1040991449968455680) how he not only beats Billings, but continues to drive him and make sure he knows exactly who won the rep. This is something that the best of the best will do consistently. They make sure to slowly wear you down to simply accepting that you can't get past him. That's what I highlight a lot when I talk about Jonathan Ogden, and it's something I am happy to see coming from Yanda as well. Mind games are essential to the trenches, and Yanda is a master at it.

Obviously, teams generally do their best to retain elite talent, so many of the recent top running backs have spent their career with one team throughout their prime.  For example:


Forte in CHI, AP in MIN, Beast Mode in SEA, Zeke in DAL, Gurley with the Rams, list goes on.


This all said, I am interested to see how this all will come in to play as we look at some of the RBs with recent success on new teams:

341,/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament: The #27 Pick Team,"**[Introductory Post](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/bs8vqs/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_introduction/?st=jw26hysx&amp;sh=9ca75aee)**

Over the next month, I’m going to be unveiling the best team of all time comprised solely of players drafted at that spot. We’re going to determine which draft pick, historically speaking, could yield the best team. The criteria for who I can and cannot put on that team is listed in the introductory post; remember that if a great player from the 1960s is not on this list, odds are that he got drafted twice (once by the NFL and once by the AFL) and I put him on another team that needed him more.

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the #1 team of all time comprised solely of #27 picks.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses**

**Strengths:** To say this offense may be stacked is an understatement. Dan Marino is one of the top quarterbacks in this entire tournament, and he’s got some really good receivers to throw to in DeAndre Hopkins and Roddy White, and some really good halfbacks to give the ball to. It’s a well-balanced offense that isn’t lacking for weapons in the slightest bit. Additionally, the defensive ends are pretty good as well; anytime your two defensive ends have a combined 35 years of experience in the NFL, that’s always a good sign.

**Weaknesses:** This defense is really lacking. There’s no Hall of Fame player on the defense, no all-decade player on the defense, and very few stars on the defense. Linebacker is particularly weak; the three linebackers have combined for just three Pro Bowl appearances, and there aren’t too many ball hawks in the secondary. There are some weak spots on the offensive line, but defense is where this team truly has some holes that need to be plugged up, particularly in the back seven.

**/r/NFL Poll Question of the Day**

You guys are eventually going to vote on the bracket and which team advances in each round. However, to get you guys engaged during this month-long process when I’m going through the teams, I’m going to do a simple Strawpoll question a day regarding the roster makeup of the team in question. Because today’s post is about the team of #27 draft picks, today’s question will be about the offensive controversy on this team.

**There are four skill players from the 21st century that are on this roster on the offensive side of the ball. Those players are DeAndre Hopkins, Larry Johnson, Roddy White, and DeAngelo Williams. Of these four players, who is the best player on the team?**

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18191109)**

---

**Final Thoughts**

On one hand, the defense is severely lacking on this team. There aren’t any players that could be classified as stars, and there aren’t any players that have a shot at this point at the Hall of Fame; against some of the better offensive units in the tournament, that could be a problem. On the other hand, the offense has some great weapons, including Dan Marino at quarterback. And any team with Dan Marino has a shot at winning games. This team is one of the lower ranked in the tournament, but there’s some quality pieces on this team that could make an impact down the line.

We’ll do the team of #28 picks tomorrow at 9:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day at 9:00 ET for the next team’s roster.

345,Analytics - EPA by play type,"[Chart](https://imgur.com/h3mJ7mg)

&amp;#x200B;

In an earlier post I made a contention that running backs have a lower EPA comparative to QBs and WRs because reasons.  One of the reasons was that explosive running plays tend to occur less frequently than explosive passing plays.  This chart addresses that claim.

&amp;#x200B;

What you are looking at is the distribution of positive EPA plays, categorized by each play type.  To define ""positive epa"": here I mean any play with a greater than 0.05 epa.  Why did I remove 0 to 0.05?  To eliminate plays that have only a very marginal contribution.  For example:

&gt; In the first game of the 2016 season, the Cleveland Browns lined up on 3rd-and-20 following the Philadelphia Eagles sacking QB Robert Griffin III for a 10-yard loss (this sentence pretty much sums up the 2016 Browns). On the next play, Browns' RB Duke Johnson takes a draw play up the middle for an 11-yard gain, of course failing to convert the first down resulting in the Browns once again punting...  Only 0.04 EPA.  

 \- [Source](https://www.cmusportsanalytics.com/nfl-expected-points-nflscrapr-part-1-introduction-expected-points/)

I wanted to try to focus more on bigger value contributions that 11 yard gains on 3rd and 20.  Why 0.05?  Completely arbitrary.  You got me!

Each of the bins are split up into plays with 0\* to 1 epa, 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and so on.  You can count the negative space as the plays that were negative\* epa plays, but I find more visually appealing and less distracting not display these.

Another thing to understand is why the difference between passing and receiving plays?  The passing column will account for sacks while the receiving plays will exclude them (since no pass was thrown). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observations**:

* Rushing plays are clearly less successful overall than passing plays.
* Furthermore, even when successful, a disproportionate amount are of lower value, with a majority contributing less than 1 epa.
* A team is 4 times more likely to achieve a 3+ epa play when passing compared to when they run the ball
* Again, as stated in my other post, running plays lower epa likely stems from the higher occurrence of running the ball in strategic situations.  This includes but is not limited to: setting up for a field goal, goal to go situations where EP is already high thus limiting the achieveable EPA on the play, running the ball with the lead late in the game, running the ball to close out the half and running the ball on 3rd and long where the goal is to create more space for a punt.  

So I think we CAN safely conclude that as a general rule of thumb RB EPA will be lower compared to QB and WR/TE EPA, with perhaps a slight benefit to receiving RBs.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am NOT concluding: That teams should not run the ball.  There is still reason to run the ball, not only for the reasons I outlined above, but also for many others.  

What I AM concluding: We cannot directly compare RB and receiver effectiveness with the EPA metric.  Additionally, and this seems like common sense, a team that is trailing will need to rely more heavily on the passing game to have a better chance of making an impact on the game.

**AFC Vs. NFC**

With the AFC vs. NFC, the Conference with the least votes gains immunity, and the losing conference would eliminate their team with the most votes.

For example:

|Votes received|Team|
:--|:--|
|11,307|Patriots|
|10,423|Rams|

|Votes Received|Conference|
:--|:--|
|14,342|NFC Teams|
|14,049|AFC Teams|

If the NFC receives 14,342 votes and the AFC receives 14,049 votes, then the AFC would ""Win immunity"" and the Rams would be eliminated, even though the Patriots received more votes.
  

#Everybody, drop your buffs
One thing all teammates should expect, is to be prepared for anything. As numbers started getting smaller, the disadvantage the NFC has had in the immunity challenges has been pretty clear. So with that said, everybody is going to draw a rock. If you draw a red rock, you are now AFC. If you draw a blue rock, you are now NFC.

Since the tribes are uneven, the AFC will have an extra red rock.

Below are the current teams of each tribe:

&gt;**Remember, it's just a game**  
If we want this to be an annual thing we have to be respectful of the platform. That means leaving the rest of reddit and r/nfl alone. Keep the game within the official Survivor threads on r/nfl, team subs (with permission), and faction subreddits (/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil, /r/coalitionagainstevil, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood, /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/BIRDTEAMS, /r/GoodLeagueofGood, /r/CoalitionOfChaos, /r/PlunderBirds, /r/CoalitionAgainstBirds, /r/LakeErieBros, /r/ACAACO, /r/CatTeamCoalition, r/gangofgreen, /r/ColtKillers, /r/unionforfreeteams, /r/CORLS.)
Reaching out to your friends is fine, reaching out to outside subs/forums With mods permission is fine. I nor the mods of /r/NFL want thousands of messages wondering why someone is going to their forums about survivor. Most of Reddit outside of the people here that play and participate don't really care that much. I don't want to anger those users.
(Tip: If you want your team sub to allow Survivor discussion, don't annoy your team mods with multiple threads a day)  

   

The team with the most votes will be the team that's voted out. This will go on for 30 rounds until there are 3 teams remaining. On the 30th round (the Final Tribal Council), users will then decide the winner of Survivor out of the 3 remaining teams.

392,Josh McCown already looks like an ESPN veteran.,"It didn't take him long to fit right in and fire off those hot takes on SportsCenter. He was just asked to list his Top 5 WR and came up with this:

1. Julio Jones

2. Michael Thomas

3. Odell Beckham Jr.

4. Julian Edelman

5. Mike Evans

Ordinarily I wouldn't care, but given that this is his first appearance (to my knowledge), it doesn't bode well. I've always been a fan of Josh, but he still might be suffering from some post-concussion syndrome from that helicopter hit he took against the Jets when he was on the Browns all those years ago. The board he was drawing from had the names of 10 players. Among the players that were on the board but not included in the list were JuJu, Davante Adams, T.Y. Hilton, Antonio Brown, and DeAndre Hopkins. Tyreek Hill (understandable), A.J. Green, Keenan Allen, Amari Cooper (bit of a stretch), and Adam Thielen weren't even mentioned.

His justification for putting Edelman at #4 is championships and clutch. ""He may not have the numbers of some of these guys, but his ability to win in big moments is huge."" I know Jules just won SB MVP, but it's laughable to put him over AB and Hopkins. He then talks about how much he loves size, but doesn't even have A.J. Green on the list. He only mentions Hopkins once in passing while talking about catch radius. His reason for leaving AB off the list is that he's in a new system, but he has OBJ at #3. I know the Browns are in a better position to win, but that's a pretty big contradiction.

I'm not sure if he was looking to make a splash, or just wanted some diversity (in terms of skill-set and play style), but this list doesn't instill much confidence in him going forward.",nfl,danielbauer1375,29,2019-06-19

403,Analytics - EPA by run location and gap,"[https://imgur.com/d3gtLLD](https://imgur.com/d3gtLLD)

&amp;#x200B;

This is an admittedly lower effort post, but still relevant.  Kind of a followup to my other EPA analyses, this one looks at the run game based on run location (left, right, center) and run gap (end, guard, tackle, NA = Center).  I've also separated out QB scrambles.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried weeding out game situation where low value runs are expected (last 2 minutes of each half) but they had a negligible impact, so I included them for sample size.

&amp;#x200B;

Takeaways:

* A QB scramble is generally better than a designed run... could this lead to more designed QB scrambles?
* End runs are most effective, followed by guard.  Tackle and middle runs are the worst.

Note: Take the QB scrambles with a grain of salt, particularly the guard/tackle/middle ones because sample size gets tight.  Lowest sample was 22 which isn't awful but isn't great either.  Samples for the end runs were 100+.",nfl,immensely_bored,4,2019-06-19

414,"NFL100: 100 Days, 100 Years (Day 23)"," 

To celebrate 100 days until the 100th season, it is time to continue counting down to the historic centennial season of the National Football League.

Over the 100 days leading up to kickoff, we’ll look at each season since the very beginning, and how the league has evolved to today’s game.

Season 23: 1942 NFL (National Football League)

Duration: September 13-December 13, 1942

Teams: 10

1942 NFL Draft: 200 selections (22 rounds), held in Chicago, IL.

1942 First Draft Pick: Bill Dudley, Halfback from the University of Virginia (Pittsburgh Steelers)

1942 NFL Championship Game: Washington Redskins (10-1-0) defeated Chicago Bears (11-0-0) 14-6 at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C.

This season featured the following rule changes:

\-The use of flags on flexible shafts to mark the intersections of goal lines and side lines (the predecessor to the pylon) becomes mandatory.

\-A clarification to the offsides rule is added: The center or snapper is not offsides unless a portion of his body is ahead of the defensive team's line.

\-A half cannot end on a double foul. Instead, the period will be extended by one untimed down.

\-Detachable kicking toes are prohibited.

\-When an encroachment or false start causes the other team to be offsides, only the initial foul is penalized.

\-A forward pass that first touches an ineligible receiver may be intercepted.

\-If the offensive team commits pass interference in their opponent's end zone, it is an automatic touchback.

After 5 weeks, Chicago Bears head coach George Halas stepped down to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II.

The 1942 NFL Championship game was between two teams who went a combined 21-1-0 during the regular season. It matched the undefeated Western Division champion Chicago Bears (11–0) and the Eastern Division champion Washington Redskins (10–1). The Bears were co-coached by Hunk Anderson and Luke Johnsos (after George Halas had entered the U.S. Navy) and led on the field by quarterback Sid Luckman. The Redskins were led by head coach Ray Flaherty and quarterback Sammy Baugh.

This was the second and final NFL title game played at Griffith Stadium and in the city of Washington. The two teams met on the same site 2 years earlier with a far different result, as the visiting Bears won in a 73–0 rout. 

Chicago had won easily in the summer exhibition game with Washington, but the teams had not met during the 1942 regular season. The Bears were aiming for their 3rd consecutive league title and were favored by 3 touchdowns, but were upset 14–6 by the home underdog Redskins.

418,How qualified are the people grading for PFF?,"PFF say they grade every snap for every player, but they never specify the actual person who was responsible for watching this tape and how qualified that person is.

How do we know this person has any experience with football? Does this person know what responsibilities each player has on a play and how that responsibility could change? Can a person that isn't within the system that the offense or defense runs fully comprehend this in the first place? Do they know if two secondary players swap responsibilities whenever a given route concept presents itself in the middle of the play? Which player is then responsible for the deep middle zone and which is responsible for the middle sideline. Are they looking to see if a DB should have used a stack technique or a trail technique for a given down and distance? What if the coach specifically asked these players to play the receiver this way for this play call? I know if you did decide to read this you will likely get the point by now, but I could go on so much further.

He's still a bit of an enigma with only ~200 throws to his name really. The two games he started with the Patriots he was phenomenal and that largely transported to his first 5 games with the 49ers. However I was re-watching every throw he made from this past season and he was honestly atrocious, just addicted to throwing the ball at the wrong team.

485,/r/NFL All-Time Draft Pick Tournament: The #28 Pick Team,"**[Introductory Post](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/bs8vqs/rnfl_alltime_draft_pick_tournament_introduction/?st=jw26hysx&amp;sh=9ca75aee)**

Over the next month, I’m going to be unveiling the best team of all time comprised solely of players drafted at that spot. We’re going to determine which draft pick, historically speaking, could yield the best team. The criteria for who I can and cannot put on that team is listed in the introductory post; remember that if a great player from the 1960s is not on this list, odds are that he got drafted twice (once by the NFL and once by the AFL) and I put him on another team that needed him more.

So, with that being said, here’s a look at the #1 team of all time comprised solely of #28 picks.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses**

**Strengths:** The secondary is loaded from top to bottom with talent. There really is not a weak link in that unit. Green is a Hall of Famer, and everyone else in the secondary has made it to the Pro Bowl at least once. The four players in the secondary have a combined 160 interceptions between them, which says a lot. Additionally, the defensive tackles are really strong; Trevor Pryce and Don Colo are somewhat forgotten in NFL history, but were both very good players at their peaks, and putting the two together could cause havoc against some of the weaker interior lines in the field.

**Weaknesses:** Take Joe Staley out of the equation, and the rest of the offensive line has a combined zero All Pro nominations from the Associated Press. This line is on the weaker side of things, even if it has a rock like Joe Staley back there. To make matters worse, Johnny Clement at quarterback is really bad; the only other option was Mark Malone, and Pittsburgh fans can attest to how bad Malone was. The rest of the offense is fairly mediocre, and while Derrick Brooks is a fantastic piece to the front seven, the rest of that unit could be better.

**/r/NFL Poll Question of the Day**

You guys are eventually going to vote on the bracket and which team advances in each round. However, to get you guys engaged during this month-long process when I’m going through the teams, I’m going to do a simple Strawpoll question a day regarding the roster makeup of the team in question. Because today’s post is about the team of #28 draft picks, today’s question will be about the secondary on this team.

**The four defensive backs on this team all have at least one Pro Bowl appearance and all had successful NFL careers. These four defensive backs are Bobby Dillon, Darrell Green, Monte Jackson, and Darryl Williams. Of these four, who is the weakest link?**

**[Vote Here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18196767)**

---

**Final Thoughts**

There are parts of this team that are very strong. Paul Warfield, Derrick Brooks, and Darrell Green are some of the best players at their positions, and are in the Hall of Fame for a reason. But while this team has the occasional shining moment, it lacks consistency. The quarterback situation is dire, the offensive line is poor at points, and there isn’t a whole lot to get excited about outside of an incredible secondary. Still, the secondary being incredibly tough to throw on might be able to get this team a game in the tournament.

We’ll do the team of #29 picks tomorrow at 9:00 ET. Be sure to check back every day at 9:00 ET for the next team’s roster.

Super Silly Soccer is easy to play, but hard to master.

Score goals on with two modes: Levels and Endless. Levels are custom-made levels that will challenge your speed and smarts, as these levels are made like puzzles. Endless modes gives you three chances to score a goal per level as the challenge ramps up.

Once you have earned some coins in either of those modes, spend them in the Locker Room on a new ball! These are either your favorite animal, or something completely random!

158,Why would you deploy a 3-4-3 formation when you feel threatened even with the high risk?,"Strengths of the 3-4-3

Recently i have noticed many football teams (UK) deploy this high risk formation when they are away. Seems like too much risk to me, but it is countered when defenders are placed on the wings within the midfield. on further research, this seems quite common when deploying this tactic. is this just to make sure that the defence can cope if it’s under attack? the wingers will fall back to help the three defenders? Why would you play a 3-4-3 if you feel “theatened” as a manager? 

You have to switch position so much in a 3-4-3, does it not make sense to just have five at the back, then push forward as necessary, keeping the positioning the same throughout? the 3-4-3 seems like many of the wingers and defenders would always be changing position to cope with the potential attacks of the other team. in turn, causing problems. 

why so then, is it commonly seen when you least expect it?

167,Is it just me or late 90's-mid 2000's was football's best time?,"It's probably nostalgia, because I grew up at this period, but I used enjoy football more. At first, I thought I just used to admire footballers more. Guys like Ronaldo (both), Drogba, Nedved, Pirlo, Zidane, Beckham were like heroes, superhumans even. About the new generation (Mbappé, Firmino, Van Dijk, etc), they're great, but it just isn't the same. They're just people who happen to be really good at football. I think we may have social media to blame. It brought players closer to us.

But, rewatching, some old matches, I see that football itself was more appealing too. Maybe it was technically worse, but it was more fun to watch. I think we became too defensive. Attackers aren't as important as before (iconic attack duos are gone, btw) and defenders (and defensive midfielders) are becoming more and more important.

What are your thoughts on it? Like I said, it's probably nostalgia. Older people may think their time was better and younger fans may think we're living football's prime today.",football,FieryMarmito,69,2020-01-16

426,The fact that Erling Håland signed for Dortmund for £17m but Southampton rejected a £20m bid from Leeds United to sign Che Adams is proof that English football is broken and the self-imposed 'luxury tax' on English players actually does exist.,"A few seasons ago, former Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino famously said that the vast majority of English players, forwards and wingers, are grossly overvalued by their clubs and that it was almost like a self imposed luxury tax just because the player happens to be a certain ethnicity.

He said this in response to speculation that he had a bias towards purchasing Italian players and very rarely looked interested in buying English prospects, he went on to say that there were some players in Italy that would just as good as their counterparts in England, but because they weren't English they were only worth a fraction of what their equal counterpart in England might be worth.

I have to say, when I initially heard him say that I called complete and utter bullshit, but the fact that Dortmund were able to somehow sign a UEFA Champions League proven player like Erling Håland for what is the equivalent of about 17 million pounds, but Southampton rejected a 20 million pound bid from Leeds United to buy Che Adams, a bloke who is only actually making his Premier League debut this season and is yet to actually score a single Premier League goal, surely you all have to agree the system is well and truly broken?

In no universe is Che Adams and even remotely comparable player to Erling Håland, nor should he even be in the same conversation in terms of value.

I think we can all agree that Dortmund got an absolutely brilliant deal and then negotiators need to be given a pay rise immediately, but Southampton, come on.",football,CCLaity,78,2020-01-22

 While sports fans are often very dedicated to their game of choice, they’re not likely to attend a game alone, according to a new report by [***Quartz***](https://qz.com/1785101/nfl-fans-are-more-likely-than-nba-fans-to-buy-single-tickets/).

Ticket data, which was recorded from 2015 to 2019 via secondary ticketing site Vivid Seats, shows that about half of sports tickets are purchased in pairs, with 39% in bundles of three or more. Only 12% of all tickets purchased for sporting events are for a single ticket; nearly 29% of tickets purchased for PGA Tour events were single tickets, followed by horse racing at 25%, and NFL at 20%. This is a stark difference from Minor League Baseball and National Hockey League tickets, which were 6% and 8%, respectively.

This data likely boils down to how each sport is viewed. PGA Tour tickets are usually offered in general admission, as well as racing events, which means that people usually buy their tickets separately, even if they’re attending with friends.

The team with the football got the ball inside the 5 after a good punt. Then the team with the ball gets tackled in their own end zone for a safety. The team is now down by 1 late in 4th and are kicking off. This would normally be a situation where the kicking team would want to perform an onside kick but after a safety you are forced to punt on the kick off.

212,Whole-History Ratings - Automated Premier and Football League Rankings,"I originally posted this to /r/soccer but it got removed by the mods, so instead of trying to post there again, I figured I'd try posting here, I hope you find it interesting and I do intend to continue doing more of these here in future!

Unless any of you frequent /r/MMA, it's unlikely you'll have seen my previous posts about the Whole-History Rating system that I took and adapted/implemented for MMA. It's a non-linear rating system that was designed to be a major improvement on Elo and after comparing it with other rating systems, I chose it as the most accurate of the ones I'd tried and so far it has an overall prediction rating of 66% across a history of nearly 300,000 fights.

I've been following football for longer than MMA and I've been a season ticket holder at Oxford United since 05/06, so I figured I should at least see what this rating system produced when I ran it for football results. I put together a database of around 600,000 matches dating back to the earliest record of the FA Cup, including leagues from around the world and as many international results as I could find and then ran the rating system on that data. It took a lot longer than expected and didn't reach convergence (it basically didn't get to its peak accuracy potential before I stopped it running) however it got pretty close and these ratings wouldn't change much if I had left it running any longer.

Unlike with MMA, I don't really think football is in much need of an improved system for rankings since we already have divisions for that in the first place, although I do believe that leagues would be far better if goal difference was used instead of points (as it would prevent if not eliminate time-wasting in matches as well as make it mathematically possible for anyone to win the league from any point, theoretically speaking) but otherwise I can't complain much.

I've broken the teams up into their respective divisions, but the ratings should let you compare teams across different divisions too, so you can see how teams in one league line up to teams in another. It's worth noting before looking at these that they're meant to reflect the current skill of a team as they are right now and while results this season affect the ratings more than results beforehand, this isn't meant to be a league system since a solid win or loss streak can quickly take a team to the top or bottom of these ratings.

If you're interested in more information about the rankings, just leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer it, otherwise, you can find all my posts about it relating to MMA and the rankings site for MMA (as well as links to the original whitepaper): [Previous Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kezyma/comments/c3u867/mma_wholehistory_rating_previous_posts/) &amp; [Ratings Site](https://mma.kezyma.com/)

Whatever your personal opinion of Guardiola is, you have to agree that when his style of play works, it produces extremely eye-catching football. He's a genius who needs the best players in every position (apart from at the back) and a bit of gamesmanship. It wasn't always like that - his style of play has evolved and reached its peak in 2017-18 with MCFC. But what happens when he leaves? Does he lose the entire dressing room and leaves the next manager to pick up the pieces like Mourinho? Do clubs continue to play beautiful football or do they struggle? Read on to find out!

332,What's everyone's thoughts on VAR in the Premier League now we're almost half way through the season?,"Now that we're almost half way through the Premier League season I wanted to find out how people now stand on VAR. Personally I think that while the system isn't perfect and still needs improvements it's a much needed tool in modern day football.

Yes some of the decisions can take sometime to be made which isn't great for the fans in the grounds but personally I'd rather wait for this to get the correct result, especially if it aids my team. Despite some of the offside calls being a bit of a joke, such as Sterling and Lundstram which come to mind, this is more of an issue with the refereeing standard in England which has notoriously been very low for a number of years now.

Here is a video I posted on YouTube earlier in the season expressing my thoughts on the system so would love for you guys to watch it: [https://youtu.be/NDJtpA9wfVU](https://youtu.be/NDJtpA9wfVU).

He had awesome pace, and deadly finishing. Also, he was the 2007 balon d'or winner. I genuinely believe he's a better player than Neymar. He peaked in the generation before the extreme messi/ronaldo hype - a time when (I personally feel) the game had more class, and more 'magic'. I swear, I'm not tryna sound like an old person lol. 

Maybe I'm just nostalgic for that classic Rossaneri lineup. Either way, here's to one of the greatest players of all time who sometimes is overlooked.",football,yeetinthetrash,47,2019-12-23

456,Potential of Algerian Football,"There have been many top class football players of Algerian descent. Zidane, Benzema, Mahrez, and Mbappe are/were very good. All of these players have come from France and have Algerian descent. There is also a rather long list of other serviceable players of Algerian descent that are also out of France.

There have been no world class players come straight from Algeria. There's no doubt that the French soccer system and its academies are much better than Algerias'. You might as well be comparing a Ferrari with a wheelbarrow. They're not in the same realm. But what if Algeria was able to get proper academies, player development, soccer infrastructure etc? The results could really shake up international football.

There is an estimated around 2-3 million Algerians living in France. There are around 40 million in Algeria. So 15 to 20x more people of Algerian descent in Algeria to France. 

It's unlikely that Algeria will ever be able to produce 15 to 20 times the amount of Algerian talent in France, but 2 to 3 times the production in the future is not out of the realm of possibility. 2 times and you have a world cup contender, 3 times and they're one of the favorites. There is so much untapped potential in this undeveloped country, and it makes me sad about the dismal success that Algeria has had with having a proper soccer system. It also makes me hopeful of the coming decades and the possibilities if they ever figure out how to put it all together. A half decent developmental system would likely be enough to reach 2 to 3 times the output of France. A world class system would cement them as one of the top football nations in the world.

I wrote a lot about the potential, but at this point even half the production that France has had with developing players of Algerian descent would be a huge success. We can only hope that they get their shit together.",football,Hennythepainaway,1,2019-12-24

483,Liverpool's trophy cabinet compared to every club in professional sports following their FIFA Club World Cup win,"Liverpool have won 62 trophies in their illustrious footballing history - 18 league titles, 7 FA Cups, 8 League Cups, 15 FA Community Shields, 6 European Cups, 3 UEFA Cups, 4 Super Cups, and 1 FIFA Club World Cup ([https://www.transfermarkt.us/liverpool-fc/erfolge/verein/31](https://www.transfermarkt.us/liverpool-fc/erfolge/verein/31)). Everyone knows this makes the club one of the most decorated in Europe, but what about if you compared their success to that of clubs all over the world, and not just in football but in all of professional team sports? With the help of stats compiled by u/SportsFan591 (and with his blessing to use them), you can see the following:

**FOOTBALL -** [https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/30-most-successful-football-clubs-19428893](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/30-most-successful-football-clubs-19428893)

* Recently published stats on the most decorated football clubs in the world have been based on lists generated just before the club's continental treble of the European Cup, European Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup this year. Factoring these three into the count means that Liverpool are officially the **16th** most decorated football club on Earth, ahead of clubs such as AC Milan, Inter Milan, PSG, Arsenal, Boca Juniors, River Plate, Galatasaray, Anderlecht, Atletico Madrid and Marseille while being just behind Juventus.

**BASKETBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/dvdds0/basketball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/dvdds0/basketball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* Liverpool's trophy haul would place them within the top 6 on the list of the most decorated basketball clubs ever. The club's haul of 62 trophies would see them come **6th** and just one trophy off the top 5.

* Liverpool would place **4th** when their success is measured against all rugby league clubs, just being edged out by 2nd and 3rd-placed Leeds Rhinos and St. Helens but 12 trophies ahead of next best placed South Sydney Rabbitohs.

**BASEBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* Liverpool finish **2nd** in comparison to all baseball clubs, almost five trophies ahead of third-placed Yomiuri Giants of Japan, 24 trophies ahead of fifth-placed Draci Brno of the Czech Republic and only five trophies off the pace from the sport's most successful side, the New York Yankees.

**HANDBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

499,"As a fan, how did/ do you deal with your team getting relegated?","Greetings fellow football fans,

I'm a simple football fan from Belgium and the team I'm supporting is Cercle Brugge. Today they lost a very important game 1-0. Now this isn't anything new, but the way how was so disgusting. First off all, the 0-1 got disallowed wrongly due to VAR. Secondly, the 1-0 a player was clearly off-side yet the goal stood. Our closest ""rival"" for relegation won their home game (on a very lucky game where they had like 20% of the ball...). The gap is now 6 points with 9 games to go. You might think there is still time for my team to be saved, but the games that are left are brutal. Imagine having to play Mancity/ Liverpool/ Leicester and Wolves all in a row. Well that is how the cards are dealt for them. Even the saddest part is; they don't play bad football, they aren't relegation material (believe me, there are like 2 that just play sooo bad). Cercle got relegated before, but I wasn't a fan back then (and some of those seasons they were so bad that they deserved it). This seasons feels like a season where it is never enough. Good football, no results. Fighting for every inch on the pitch, being deemed the ""better"" team on all our sports media; but relegation seems imminent. 

Have you ever been in this situation and how did you deal with it? Just so you know, the second division in Belgium is one very big mess and a lot of clubs go there to die. (It is a financial graveyard).",football,patrat96000,68,2019-12-26
1,Was Luis Enrique right to have criticised Moreno publicly?,"Enrique is back to the Spanish national team as coach, and many were left surprised that he didn’t appoint Moreno as his assistant.

To me Moreno was honest all through the process, letting it known that he would step down once Enrique returned, and this he did.

Enrique might have personal reasons not to want Moreno on his coaching staff again, and that is acceptable. But going to the public sphere to call him ""disloyal"" and ""ambitious"" are unfair.

Even reacting to the bashing, Moreno has refrained from taking a jibe at Enrique.

Just want your views guys...was Luis right to have slammed his former assistant in that way?",football,tundeolobe,2,2019-11-29

Lucien Favre still gets the backing from the management but the overall feeling is he lost the team - several players said they had problems with the tactics, key players play shit and the whole team seems unmotivated.

I wonder if there are any examples of coaches in a similar situation who were able to turn around their fate, gain back their standing and motivate their team again to take them back to new heights.

Certainly they could sell the players but Dortmund just invested 130m into the roster and honestly it has way more potential than it's showing right now. It seems Favre ran out of ideas how to unlock it.

Cheer me up with some examples where a coach was able to turn around a situation like that.",football,crispinpowers,2,2019-11-29

Everyone knows this makes the club one of the most decorated in Europe, but what about if you compared our success to that of clubs all over the world, and not just in football but in all of professional team sports? With the help of stats compiled by u/SportsFan591 (and with his blessing to use them), you can see the following:

**FOOTBALL -** [https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/30-most-successful-football-clubs-19428893](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/30-most-successful-football-clubs-19428893)

* Recently published stats on the most decorated football clubs in the world seem to have taken our 66 trophies and added to them our 5 Manchester Cups won in the 1800s while it was still a first-team competition before the club turned professional. However, as these were not professional victories and the club themselves dont recognise them amongst our honours haul ([https://www.manutd.com/en/history/trophy-room](https://www.manutd.com/en/history/trophy-room)), I believe it'd be fair to remove them and thus United would go from the 12th to the **14th** most decorated club in the world. Still though, a comfortable top-15 place!

* Manchester United's trophy haul would place us within the top 5 on the list of the most decorated basketball clubs ever. Our haul of 66 trophies would see us come **5th.**

**AMERICAN FOOTBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would also place **2nd** when their success is measured against all rugby league clubs, just edging out Leeds Rhinos and St. Helens but well off the pace from Wigan Warriors, by far the most dominant team in the sport and arguably the most dominant team within one sport in the entire sporting world.

I think managers like Luis Enrique, Thomas Tuchel, Max Allegri, Antonio Conte, Leonardo Jardim, Diego Simeone, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann would all challenge both Guardiola and Klopp if they were manager for one biggest clubs in PL.

347,Ansu Fati most overrated player 2019,"This kid played 9 games, scored twice and managed to finish 6th for the golden boy award. What the actual fuck?! How is this a thing? People are actually calling him better than rodrigo who scored 3 goals in 1 game. The only reason ansu fati ranked so high on the golden boy list is because he's 16 years old and plays for barca. I mean there's so many good players that didn't even make the golden boy shortlist while fati literally made it based on o games.

385,How would Luis Enrique fare as Arsenal boss?,"Luis Enrique are in my opinion one of the most underrated managers in world football, and he usually gets more shit than praise for his works. Enrique apparanly won the treble with Barcelona only due to the players he had, funny wise armchair experts said the same thing about Pep before he moved to Bayern and City. Anyway, Luis Enrique was very close of succeeding Wenger as Arsenal boss in 2018 but ulmtimately the job went to Emery. But i really wonder, what could Enrique have achieved with Arsenal? i\`m 100% certain he would have done a better job than what Emery did. But would Enrique have established Arsenal as a solid top 4 club again and would he have made Arsenal challenge for the title again?

I know this is somewhat of a stupide question, but i just cant help but wonder ""what if"" regarding Arsenal/Enrique.",football,Joeal88,18,2019-12-06

Moments after Forster had saved superbly from Alfredo Morelos, Celtic took the lead as Christopher Jullien fired home from Ryan Christie's excellent free kick on 60 minutes.

The result means Celtic have won every single trophy available domestically since the 2016-17 League Cup, with captain Scott Brown having claimed his 20th major honour.

His dream is to become a professional player and at this rate I actually think that isn’t unrealistic for him.

69,Zlatan Ibrahimovic is overrated,"Please hear me out before commenting. Zlatan is a great player. One of the best of our generation however I feel that people give him way more credit than he deserves.

Zlatan is an absolute beast with the ball. We all know his capabilities so I don't need to explain them. He has countless wonder goals and skill highlights but he has never been a player to take over a game or lead his team. IMO. A lot of people seem to forget this

I don't know much about his time in Ajax but whatever. It's the Dutch League :). Anyways, At Juventus he had one good season if I can recall. His second was awful and They were stripped of the two titles anyways. Regardless, that Juve team had great players who often overshadowed Zlatan.

Onto Inter Milan. This is where he begins to truly break out into a world class talent. I remember avidly watching the Serie A during this time for whatever the hell reason... Zlatan tore up the league and dominated for 3 straight seasons. He was amazing but.... He was also playing in the Serie A. Milan, Juve and others had been severely weakened from the Scandal. Juventus went to Serie B and came back much weaker. AC Milan lost a lot of momentum and Inters biggest challenger was Roma at one point. He failed in Big European matches (vs United in 2008 for example)

His time in Barca was average but that wasn't completely his fault as we all know...  His time in Milan with AC was very good especially when they won the title. I'll give him that. Then we go to Paris. Zlatan was the Face of Ligue 1 but let's be real... It's Ligue 1. Again he would disappear in big Champions League games

At United he was probably their best player at points but a Europa League title doesn't mean much compared to how highly he's rated. Even on the International scene. He has never taken Sweden far in a Tournament or even been close to. Sweden failed to qualify for a WC with him in the squad and I honestly don't recall him taking over a meaningful international match. Correct me if I'm wrong though. It's not like Sweden is a terrible team. They have had many top players play all across Europe. For example, Croatia apart from Rakatic and Modric is a team filled with ""B"" level players. Not really top class and the best players in the big leagues. They have a bunch of ""Decent"" players yet Modric was able to drag them into the final. Zlatan has never done this in the Champions League or international tournaments",football,Scottie3Hottie,7,2019-11-15

192,Mourinho's Tottenham,"If, as being reported, Tottenham go ahead and appoint Mourinho to their vacant position of Manager, I think it'll prove to be a masterstroke. 

I've read a lot of comments that claim it'll never work because Levy will not sanction the expensive purchases Mou will demand. Jokes aside, I think they're all missing a couple of key points. 

First off, with a new stadium, Spurs finances should be able to afford the fairly expensive players. This is just my speculation, but no money was available when they were trying to build the stadium. It's up now. And the run to the Finals would've helped their stature &amp; accounts a lot. 

More importantly though, this squad is just *ideal* for Mou. Just look at it. Mou plays with either a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1. The squad has barely any holes to plug, and quality back-ups to the starters.

**Midfield** : 

NDombele is the perfect physical-yet-technical player Mou cherishes. He can easily be Mou's Essien. Sissoko is of a similar mould, a dynamic mid who'll work hard. He's got two defensive mids like Wanyama and Dier, who're perfect for the double pivot if he wants that. Or he can pair one with a dynamic mid, depending on the opposition. He can even play the three man mid, with one of Dier/ Winks/ Wanyama playing in between Ndombele/ others. There's plenty of choices and options pairings and tactical flexibility. He's got three highly creative mids like Celso (who I'm a fan of, and expect him to really shine under Mou), Ali and Eriksen. They can all fit in the double pivot, three man midfield or even a four man diamond. All quality players. 

**Defense** :

I foresee Aurier getting a massive resurgence here. I always liked him, and was quite surprised he wasn't playing a whole lot. His discipline issues (called Blanc a 'faggot') will never fly under Mou. He won't even feel the need. Expect him to shine and Mou to turn him in the next Maicon. Sanchez is perfect for Mou, a physical, all hustle destroyer. Pair him with a cultured mid like Vertonghen or Alderwereld and watch them shine. It's been done under Poch too, but expect Mou to add some clever twists in their roles, fix some tiny details which make this a truly formidable pairing. Even Rose in that left-back slot is fantastic, a hard worker with not many issues. 

**Attack** : 

Son is the perfect Jose player, a quality-yet-humble player who'd do what the manager asks, no questions asked. Expect him to play a big role in Mou's Tottenham. Kane is Kane, but I expect him to find another gear under Mou. Either through defensive effort, or shaping his whole attack in a way to highlight Kane's qualities. I even like the Lamela/ Moura pair on right wing. Lamela can be his Pandev, where he moves inside while Aurier bombs forward, while Lamela can be the late sub to torture tired legs. 

**Holes to Plug** : 

First off, they need a back-up to Kane. How does a team like Spurs go into a new season as potential challengers with only one centre forward? If Milan will consider letting Piatek go, that's an avenue. Otherwise there's also Werner. 

They might also need a new goalie. Not that Lloris is bad or anything, it just means that if Mou sees Lloris as a back-up (he's 32), then expect money to be spent on a younger starter. If he regards Lloris as a capable starter, then a new back-up!? New centre backs will be needed pronto if Vetonghen and Toby leave.

If Mou decides that the attack needs re-shaping, I can see them selling Moura, Lamela etc. for players that'll compliment Kane more, maybe the likes of Sancho or Havertz; young players who're ready now.

**Biggest Impact Areas** :

Renewals - Can you imagine Mou convincing Toby, Eriksen and Vertonghen to renew? I can. He's the kind of star name coach that gets people to buy-in. Would they rather win with Tottenham or go to Man. Utd.? I think this might've been another reason why Poch was let go. They came close, but never reached the top. Now the results were bad and squad was getting dissuaded. Mou's name and history means they might keep their best players, rather than having to invest 100m in the market. 

Iron Test for the players - How players like Aurier, Sessgnnon and Foyth react will shape how well they play. They take Mou's criticism in stride and they'll fulfil their potential. They start moaning like they're the champs and it'll go horribly. Personally, I think this squad, with their hunger, is ideal for Mou to motivate. 

Winning mentality for the squad - Mou wins. There's no denying that. And he'll bring that hunger which the Spurs currently might be lacking (along with some critical tactical insights). They're going to be pushed in ways they'd never have imagined before. Given their lack of trophies, I expect almost all of them to react beautifully. 

Re-assignment of riles - Can anyone foresee Ali suddenly become a Lampard type central mid? I think he's up for a complete re-styling of roles. Expect him to get a defensive aspect to his game he's never shown before. I liken the change to when Wolverine got infused with Adamantium. Expect Celso go become Mou's Snijder, or to undergo a similar transformation himself. 

All-in-all, I think this is [**the ideal appointment for Mourinho**](https://old.reddit.com/r/football/comments/d0ud4z/mourinhos_next_job/). Apart from having lots of money, Real and Manchester United were not the ideal habitat for Mourinho. Tottenham is.

234,The Great Gareth Barry Conundrum!,"Hello Football Fans of Reddit! Well, this is my first post here on this thread, and I'm looking for a fruitful discussion. 

Gareth Barry is a player that definitely divides an opinion amongst the crowd. While he has a career to be proud of: a Premier League, FA Cup winner with Manchester City, UEFA Intertoto Cup winner with Aston Villa, more than 50 caps for England. And above all, a record holder for most of appearances in the Premier League. 

But at the same time, personally it is always unsettling for me to think, ""if *this* was longevity, why is he not held in higher regard""? He was a part of a famous Aston Villa team, and emerging blue half of the Manchester. And just when people thought he was done for, he reemerges under Roberto Martinez's Everton. 

So, my question is pretty straight forward: ""How good is Gareth Barry""?
Is he underrated? Overrated? A mid table team midfielder more durable than others? 
Or where does he stand amongst the greats?",football,atal_pandit,8,2019-11-21

353,"If technology existed for 100% perfect offsides tracking, would you like to see it implemented?","Most top flight leagues and competitions around the world use VAR now, and how VAR is used in judging offsides have been wildly criticized in basically all of them. EPL's implementation (you can read about it [here](https://www.premierleague.com/news/1488423)) has been particularly criticized as being against the spirit of the rule. 

If we removed the human element from this at all, would this be something you'd want in your league? Where even a millimeter past the last defender would buzz the head ref's watch and he'd immediately call for offsides.

As an extension and to combat the (I believe quite valid) argument about the spirit of the rule, if this technology existed would you like to see some sort of change to the offsides rule for leagues using this technology to build in some sort of buffer? Something like ""Any part of the body that is more than 0.3m beyond the last defender is immediately flagged for offsides""?",football,thepinkbunnyboy,0,2019-11-24

492,"I haven't played Football in about 8-9 months, and for the new season as a Goalkeeper I have lost my instincts to just save shots in general. How do I regain the instincts and reflexes to save shots again?","Here's a bit of background information:

* Last year, I made the Varsity team as the Starting Goalkeeper, and back then I was actually pretty good.
* We won our regional tournament last year, but many of our senior players graduated, so only 4 players (including myself) have stayed on the team for this year.

However, this year is different. I no longer have the same instincts and reflexes to save shots anymore, if the shot is placed well enough that I have to dive, I cannot get my legs and my whole body to react to the shot and save it and it would usually blow by me. I don't think that I'm confident in myself when it comes to saving shots.

When asked why, a team official commented that the team “realize\[es\] there may be a customer that does not have a smartphone.” That recognition of one of the basic facts surrounding the difficulties in mobile ticketing has drawn praise from the United States Minority Ticketing Group (USMTG) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). 

The mobile ticket entry system has been recognized as rife with problems as it has been forced on consumers in recent years.

256,Stoke City 0-2 West Bromwich Albion: Slaven Bilic's Baggies win to go top,"Speaking from my outsiders and amateur point of view, this was an uninteresting match. But as a Croatian who tinkers around football managers tactics, this was something interesting.

Stoke played a 532, flexible standard tactic, which is something Croatia used in 98 to achieve worlds 3rd place, under manager Chiro Blazevic. It is an all around good tactic with 5 players forward and 5 players at the back, with good midfield presence with more then enough partnerships. It doesn't ask for more nor less then 100% from players, both mentally and physically, and substitions aren't really necessary.

So why did they lose? Well, it seems Bilic's West Brom did not play by the book. They opened the match with control mentality, and dropped to counter after 60th minute in a structured control 4231 formation. Bilic knew his players will be useless after 60th minute, because control mentality means increased tempo, and players can't do that effectively for more then 60 mins, it simply wears them out. Bilic placed a bet on control strategy in an effort to score, and his girls managed it, and then he placed another bet on counter, which is most effective after 60th minute, and his girls delivered that aswell. It was sheer tactical brilliance, and very smart thinking, even though the 2nd goal was a bit unexpected, since he didn't change formation to suit counter style.

Stoke manager also deserves a lot of credit, because his tactic was one of the most well balanced, no obvious flaw tactics in the world. The only advice I could possibly give him would be to order his girls to retain possession, if possession is low, and perhaps order whipped crossess if crossess aren't connecting, If he had done that, I beleive this match would have a bit different outcome.

In any case, congrats to both managers from me, for giving me something to do in the sim and analyze.",football,Igneos79,0,2019-11-04

In the past 4 years, I’ve taken up the responsibility of being goalkeeper. While I’m certainly not the best, I am more skilled than not. I have been considering trying out for a club in the spring, as a start. I also want to get myself into better physical shape, because with the condition I’m currently in, I’m not gonna make the cut for a good club. I’m 6’ 1” and 210 lbs (95kg, for you English ppl). But my muscles are way too tight and I need to work out daily, but tried it, for a day. I could not commit to it. I need your help to find a way to (1), Commit to workouts and practice and (2), staying motivated. If I want to become a professional goalkeeper, or even college, I need to decide very soon. I know if I choose to pursue my dreams it should work out, but I’m also afraid that if I don’t, in 20 years I will be regretting not going for it. Next year it will be too late to decide.

464,Why I (as a neutral) think “Man City buying the league” is a poor argument,"‪This is a common annoyance of mine.  I do understand WHY people accuse City of buying the league, but honestly what established world class players have they actually bought since Pep became manager?  As far as I can see, all of their best players have developed and reached their prime at the club by playing well and following the philosophy of their manager.  De Bruyne was half decent but nowhere near world class when he signed, he’s now arguably the best midfielder in the world.  Sterling was talented but was nowhere near hitting his potential, he’s now one of the most dangerous wingers in the world.  Bernardo Silva was good but has only ever reached his peak at City.  Pep turned Zinchenko from an attacking midfielder into a perfectly competent left back in order to win the league last season.  I feel like focusing on City’s budget is a really poor excuse to gloss over their achievements.  Yes, they may have overpaid for certain players, but I am failing to see how they have “bought the league” when as far as I can see all they’ve done is allowed each and every one of these players to blossom and reach their full potential.  To me, that is not something you can simply buy.  You can spend millions and millions of pounds on players, but if they don’t have the commitment and dedication to perform every week, then you won’t see any results.  City absolutely do, and that’s why I get so agitated when ‘Oil Money FC’ gets thrown about like it’s that simple to build a world class squad who play that well together.  I’d like to point out that I’m not a City fan, I can just appreciate good football and find this infuriating.‬",football,Finellaclark,6,2019-11-09

481,Seriously impressed by Thiago Motta's Genoa,"I watch Genoa games regularly because they have ex-Inter youth products Radu and Pinamonti, and I want to keep an eye out on them, see if they're Inter level at some point down the line. Then there's also Kouame, another exciting young prospect. However, I was most intrigued by Motta's appointment as Manager there. Reason being, he first came into some meme worthy news when he said he wants to play a 2-7-2 formation. Was mocked when people wondered if the goalie will now play in central midfield. Turned out, he was splitting the field vertically, not horizontally. That got me interested, and when he got appointed, it gave me further reasons to start watching their games. 

Against Brescia, they played with possession, and crisp passing. They found themselves behind on the back of a fluke wonder goal by Tonali. Then they went back to the possession and passing system. Motta affected the game with his substitutions, creating a mini-history in the process. 

Against Juve, they sat back in a fundamentally sound defensive structure, then broke at pace on the counter, fully aware that their possession based game wouldn't work against the Champions. It showed that Motta is tactically competent enough to adjust his style to fit the opposition. 

They again impressed me with their passing style against Udinese. And against Napoli last night, it was a combination of a great defensive structure, then building play in a calm and collected manner. They had their moments, not just fluke chances, but holding their own against top level opposition. 

Genoa, as a team, doesn't even boast a lot of top shelf players either. They're nowhere near the talent level of Cagliari or Fiorentina. And the turn around in performance has been stark, from relegation candidates to holding their own against Juve and Napoli. Mid-season too, so no new players or a lot of pre-season training for tactics. 

All in all, I'm impressed. There's no clear cut formation (at least none that I've been able to figure out), but a lot of interchange play, passing based, but defensively sound football. If you guys want to follow a young manager to watch out for in the early part of his career, tune in to Genoa matches. I'm bullish on Motta's ability as a manager.",football,vik1980,11,2019-11-10

5,"This was written by a friend/freelance journalist. In the wake of the racism suffered by the England national team last night, I thought I'd post it here","Here's a freelance piece I wrote after a game between England and Romania U21s in Italy in June. No football magazine wanted it, which happens from time to time. Though clearly nothing's changed in the intervening months, here's hoping tonight's events might stir UEFA into actually doing something. 

I suspect I’m not alone in thinking that if the U21 European Championship were more popular, it wouldn’t be anywhere near as much fun.  As things stand - speaking as a codger who earns considerably less than the national average - I hope to continue visiting great cities I might not otherwise have heard of, pay peanuts for match tickets and beer and mix with folk who, if they had the inclination for excess, no longer have the time or the energy.  In essence, the fans of the competing nations tend to mix happily in a manner that only rugby fans think they are capable. 
Such as shame then that the tournament always seems to throw up one fixture in which racism rears its ugly head, bringing forth the same lamentable response from UEFA; one of hand wringing, platitudes and pathetic inaction. 
It’s 12 years now since my first game in the tournament; a day trip to Nijmegen to witness England’s 2-0 win over Serbia and Nedum Onuoha being subjected to some vile abuse, coming mostly in the form of monkey chants and cutthroat gestures. Two years later, after scoring a fine goal and getting himself sent off with the space of a few first half minutes, I saw a teenage Mario Balotelli visibly shaken by the vitriol that came his way during Italy’s 2-1 win in Helsingborg (birthplace of one Henrik Larsson, no less).  Therefore, it’s tragic to note how little has changed in the intervening years, a fact duly noted by many who attended the England v Romania fixture in Cesena on June 21. 
England fans knew they would be considerably outnumbered in an ancient walled city that basked in UEFA’s spotlight and embraced the tournament totally.  With 1.2 million Romanians living in a country with a very similar language, the country’s diaspora had been expected to turn up in good numbers to a tournament they hadn’t competed in for the better part of two decades.  The atmosphere in the bars en route to the stadium was first class and I certainly had no qualms about giving a couple of spare tickets to some Romanian guys in a bustling Piazza del Popolo.  At Stadio Dino Manuzzi, pulses did raise a tad, as both sets of fans took issue - albeit between themselves - with bag and body searches that were as time-consuming as they were ineffective, whilst the massed ranks of Emilia Romagna’s Carabinieri simply got in everyone’s way. 
Kick-off brought about a much nastier atmosphere, however, as Romania tore into England in search of an early goal.  What might have sounded like a raucous wall of noise from the opposite side of pitch was very different for England fans – outnumbered, I would estimate, by around 25 to 1 – thrown in with the Romania fans when the stand behind one goal hadn’t been opened. Whistling when England were in possession is one thing, but once a few lobotomised primates around me started the monkey chants, I sought a seat in a less populous part of the ground over by the corner flag.  A few minutes later, a group of female Leicester fans, appalled by the constant abuse hurled at Demarai Gray, simply got up and left the stadium. I only wish I’d had the cojones to join them.  
I found a besuited official to complain to though, who told me; “we’re trying, but there are problems occurring all around the stadium.” Such problems weren’t enough to bring the Carabinieri in off their 90-minute fag break, so we got the usual solution. Viz: A tannoy announcement trying to appeal to the better nature of folks who don’t have one in a language they might not have understood.   Soon after, when a steward failed to even blink when standing five yards from a moron who threw a bottle at James Maddison, I figured I’d had more than enough and left. 
With “officials” having decided that “whistling and booing by the Romanian fans was not racially motivated” that appears to be the end of the matter. If charges had been made, it would be reasonable to expect the Romanian FA to have adopted the same stance as their Serbian counterparts 12 years ago.  In other words, don’t blame us, we didn’t sell the tickets, you did so sort it yourself. Herein lies the tournament’s major problem. 
Almost two years ago to the day, a friend and I found ourselves in the surreal situation of chatting to Gareth Southgate over breakfast in a Kielce hotel where the U21s had stayed after meeting Slovakia in the 2017 championship.  On that occasion, a few England fans, who only had the option of buying tickets from FIFA, moved seats rather argue with the closed and diseased minds of the monkey chanters.  Around that time, the FA frequently expressed the view that not enough fans showed enough interest in the tournament for them to get involved with its organisation and distribution of tickets.  This rather dismissive attitude stood in stark contrast to that of the commercial branch of the Swedish FA, whereby the thousands of fans they take to the tournament simply had to choose an appropriate package and cough up.  Thus, we expressed the view that UEFA’s slapdash ticket distribution was likely to put in harm’s way again if the FA didn’t intervene on our behalf and sort out some segregation on the occasions when it’s clearly going to be necessary. Although English football’s main man seemed sympathetic to our plight, I’m guessing the conversation didn’t go any further once we’d all shuffled off to catch our respective flights.      
I should conclude by adding that I had (despite’s England’s endeavours to ruin it for me) a great time – these two hours in Cesena apart – making new friends and taking in six matches during the eight days I was away.  I’ll certainly be booking up for the 2021 tournament in Hungary and Slovenia. By that time, I’m hoping that raw, blatant racism will be punished with sanctions rather than platitudes, but I’m not holding my breath.",football,DAFC89,0,2019-10-15

54,"Article by Daniel Taylor via [The Athletic] - Spying firms, analysis software and a foundation of 'noodle deals' - inside Manchester United's recruitment.","Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, had his hand outstretched and a grin on his face. Manchester United were in town and Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, had just appeared in the boardroom of St James’ Park. Ashley went over to greet him and his opening line was probably an accurate reflection of the state of the two clubs.

“The most unpopular man in football meets the second most unpopular man in football,” he said.

At least Woodward could see the funny side. Ashley then introduced him to one of his associates, who turned out to be a Manchester United supporter and wanted to know why the club kept announcing “all these noodle deals” rather than player signings. Woodward’s explanation was that the two could go hand-in-hand and, without the “noodle deals”, it would be a lot harder to make the signings. Which sounded fair enough — and a line, almost certainly, he has had to trot out many times in his encounters with supporters.

The criticism has been near-unremitting lately, so perhaps it is just as well that Woodward, according to the people closest to him, understands that someone in his position cannot be too thin-skinned and has to expect scrutiny. Red News, United’s longest-running fanzine, lampooned him as Mr Bean (or Mr Bean Counter, to be accurate) on its front cover on the first weekend of the season. Inside, there was page after page devoted to his alleged failures, including a cartoon — Avram Glazer and his Puppet — in which United’s highest-ranked executive was superimposed as a ventriloquist’s dummy on the owner’s knee. Woodward’s speech bubble read: “It’s amazing you pay me £4m a year, Mr Glazer.”

A pattern has been established.

When the results are poor and the crowd restless, as they have been far too often during the post-Alex Ferguson years, the fans turn on Woodward or the owners, the Glazer family, as their default setting. When the team is doing well, which hasn’t happened nearly enough, the people at the top of the club still tend to be viewed through hard, suspicious eyes. It is never long before #woodwardout is trending on Twitter or Gary Neville, increasingly his tormentor-in-chief, is cranking up the pressure in his television role, having stated recently that it was time for somebody else to take control of United’s recruitment.

All of which should probably be expected at a club of Manchester United’s size if you take into account the number of transfer windows that can be described, at best, as challenging during the years of decline, and the general suspicion that the team is actually regressing, rather than closing the gap.

We are talking, after all, about a team that has finished, on average, 21.5 points behind the champions over the last six seasons. United have spent almost £900 million in that time and succeeded only in making themselves an irrelevance in the title race. The rest of English football is rubbernecking in their direction and, as long as that is the case, the people in charge at Old Trafford can hardly be surprised if there are questions about their level of expertise to put it right.

The only real mitigation is that there is an acceptance inside the club’s boardroom in London (United being run these days from Mayfair as well as Manchester) that their player recruitment has not been good enough. They aren’t fools and, if nothing else, they do recognise the team needs at least half a dozen new players to re-establish themselves as realistic title challengers. They are also acutely aware their own performance has to improve, starting in January when they hope to make four signings, the priority being a striker. They know, in short, that they have to do better.

That might sound like a case of stating the bleeding obvious and, to go back to the earlier point, it isn’t going to soothe the mood of their supporters at a time when the 20-time champions are two points above the relegation places and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a man once known as the baby-faced assassin, appears to have aged a year for every month he has been their manager.

Yet it is not entirely fair to say United have been guilty of complacency, along with all their more obvious shortcomings, when it comes to the business of finding the right players and putting together the resources to fix — or at least have a go at fixing — what has gone wrong.

That process can involve up to nine months of background work on certain players and, in terms of sheer numbers, sources have told The Athletic that United’s scouts and analysts watched approximately 13,800 games (academy fixtures included) in the last year of records. That’s an average of 38 per day, with scouts in more than 30 countries putting together 36,000 reports for the club’s database.

Perhaps the most eye-catching detail — never reported until now — is that United have also begun to involve what have been described as “spying firms” to carry out background checks on potential signings.

It’s a remarkable story: the famous Manchester United employing secret operatives to investigate the players they are trying to sign. Though it becomes easier to understand, perhaps, when you hear what happened with Marcos Rojo in 2014. Rojo cost £16 million from Sporting Lisbon, signing a five-year contract, yet United had absolutely no idea the player was being investigated by police for an alleged bottle attack on one of his neighbours, as well as a second man, in Argentina.

Rojo was facing the possibility of a criminal trial and, if convicted, time in prison, but United knew nothing about it until a member of staff typed his name into Google. After he had signed. To their relief, Rojo settled out of court and the case was dropped.

Due diligence is key now. The more astute clubs want as much background information as possible and, in United’s case, that is particularly important bearing in mind the staggering amounts of money they have squandered on Angel Di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Alexis Sanchez, among others.

After so many years of relying on old-fashioned techniques, one of the bigger challenges was moving away from a culture in which Ferguson ruled the roost, with the manager’s brother, Martin, operating as the club’s chief European scout and, Fergie being Fergie, the benefits that come from having the best contacts book in football.

Another 45 scouts have been added to the staff in the six years since Ferguson’s retirement and the club also place far greater emphasis now on the kind of computer data that can provide more detail than the human eye. That heavily influenced their thinking, for example, when Jerome Boateng was under consideration.

Boateng would have cost £13.1 million from Bayern Munich and, on the face of it, that was an attractive deal for a defender who had won seven Bundesliga titles, accumulated 70-odd Germany caps and been part of their 2014 World Cup win.

Harry Maguire, in contrast, ended up costing United more than six times that amount. Yet United had bought players on the cheap from Bayern before — Owen Hargreaves and Bastian Schweinsteiger — and regretted it.

They suspected there might be a catch and their in-depth analysis, using bespoke software, showed them what Bayern presumably hoped would go unnoticed: that Boateng tended to fade after 70 minutes of games, not running as far, or as fast, not making as many challenges or interceptions and becoming increasingly vulnerable to quick attackers.

United already knew Boateng had recurring injury issues and decided they already had enough centre-halves who fell into that particular category. All of which seems considerably more sensible than the decision to sign Schweinsteiger on Louis van Gaal’s watch in 2015, when there was the same underlying suspicion then, too, that Bayern would never let such a player leave unless they thought he was finished at the highest level.

Schweinsteiger signed for £14.4 million and had two largely forgettable years at Old Trafford. He made eight 90-minute appearances in the Premier League and, troubled by a variety of injuries, had a habit of flying back to Germany for treatment during the week, reappearing at weekends to watch games and then jetting off again. One senior player said he felt like Schweinsteiger was “taking the piss, absolutely taking the piss… we hardly ever saw him.”

Van Gaal had arrived at a time when United were still trying to modernise their recruitment structure. Schweinsteiger, as such, was signed purely on the manager’s say-so. Privately, United say there is no way they would make the same mistake again.

It certainly hasn’t been easy to understand a lot of United’s decision-making in the transfer market although, to give them their due, they do appear to have moved away from the days when they might have been accused of signing players as vanity projects.

Neymar is a prime example, having made it clear over the summer he was willing to sever his ties with Paris Saint-Germain.

There was a time, after all, when the Brazilian was considered the kind of player who might have been an ideal wearer of United’s colours: a genuine, category-A superstar in an era when Woodward’s long-held belief was that, at any one time, the club should have at least one Ballon d’Or contender in their squad.

At Old Trafford, however, they tell a joke that offers an insight into the club’s thinking. “If you have one Brazilian, you have one Brazilian,” it goes. “If you have two Brazilians, you have two Brazilians. And if you have three, you have a samba party.”

In Neymar’s case, United think it would be him pouring the caipirinhas.

His father, Neymar Sr, who doubles as his agent, is regarded within Old Trafford as “money-obsessed” and United’s information is that Neymar is even more fixated on winning the Ballon d’Or than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo are. That itself is not a bad thing, of course. Except there is one obvious problem: Neymar does not dedicate himself in the way of Messi or Ronaldo, both five-time winners of the award. Nor does the Brazilian seem to grasp what needs to change to make his dream a reality. For the decision-makers at United, it wasn’t a particularly difficult choice.

Joao Felix’s availability from Benfica was discussed many times, as would be expected of a player who ended up moving to Atletico Madrid this summer for £113 million. United had concerns about whether the 19-year-old had the physicality to cope with the Premier League and the possibility that he would not sustain his early promise. “Michael Ricketts was a world-beater for one season,” to quote one well-placed source. “The secret is to find someone like Mohamed Salah, who plays brilliantly one season, then the following year, and the year after that.”

Plus, United still hoped at the time that Sanchez might come good.

Instead, Sanchez never came close to justifying that mind-boggling salary of £391,000 a week before bonuses. He is now on loan at Inter Milan, injured again, and the tragicomedy is that United are still paying him £175,000 a week. Not that it is easy to detect any genuine embarrassment inside Old Trafford. United’s argument is that the footballer they signed from Arsenal in early 2018 could reasonably have been described a year earlier as the Premier League’s outstanding player.

“Nobody called us idiots at the time,” is one line. Sanchez was apparently “unbelievable” in training.

Behind the scenes at United, they like to talk about Solskjaer nurturing a “humble and arrogant” environment. Off the pitch, he tells his players to be humble — wear a suit on the team bus, fasten your top button, sign autographs, smile for the fans. On the pitch, that is where Solskjaer wants his players to be arrogant, to understand the importance of wearing that red shirt and to back themselves, to want the ball, in any tight spot.

Unfortunately for Solskjaer, it is not particularly easy to be convinced when this is United’s worst start to a season since 1989 and a time of Madchester, the Hacienda, Michael Knighton’s keepie-ups and a J-stander by the name of Pete Molyneux holding up a king-size bedsheet on which he had written in black paint: “3 Years of excuses and we’re still crap – ta-ra Fergie.” Which might sound ridiculous now but, at the time, attracted cheers and follow-up chants for Bryan Robson to take over.

Is Solskjaer in danger of losing his job? United say that is absolutely not the case. All the same, it is probably better to keep an open mind when, going back to last season, they have taken 17 points from their last 17 games (Jose Mourinho was sacked after winning 26 points over the same number of fixtures). There is also the possibility of another ordeal to come when Liverpool, the club United always measure themselves against, visit on Sunday, enjoying the view from the top of the league.

Even more perplexing is United’s continuing inability to appoint a technical director, 14 months after the club first let it be known this was among their priorities.

One of the reasons for the delay, according to information passed to The Athletic, is that Solskjaer and his assistant, Mike Phelan, tend to perform parts of this role anyway, bearing in mind it involves creating a pathway between the academy and first team, planning ahead with a three-year cycle and looking after the continuity of the club.

That, however, can feel like a bit of a cop-out when, let’s face it, Solskjaer and Phelan have enough on their plates already.

Indeed, one source at Old Trafford questions whether the original leak, from August 2018, might have been a deliberate piece of misinformation to deflect the headlines after the final transfer window of the Mourinho era ended unsatisfactorily.

All that can really be said for certain is United still insist their intention is to appoint someone and, whenever that might be, they hope that person will not be seen as some kind of “white knight” who is under immediate pressure to bring in three or four elite players. In reality, United’s senior executives will argue that, no matter what anyone else might say, they have finally got the right system in place — and it won’t change dramatically, no matter who is appointed.

That system takes the form of a transfer committee involving various executives, money-men and senior officials rather than leaving it to the manager, the old-fashioned way, and risking any more Schweinsteiger-style mistakes.

The club’s thinking is that Solskjaer — or any modern-day manager — is too busy to fly to, say, Argentina or Brazil to watch a player. But there is still an emphasis on Solskjaer “book-ending” everything, namely being involved at the beginning and end of the process. Nobody will be bought without his approval and too much is made sometimes of this theory that United value a player’s marketability almost as much as his ability with a ball at his feet.

Each player at Old Trafford is obliged, under the terms of his contract, to do six hours a week of promotional work for the club and their sponsors. In reality, United’s records show that the players do, on average, 48 minutes a week.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s £45 million transfer from Crystal Palace is a typical case.

That process began with Solskjaer informing the club they needed a new right-back and going into specific details about the qualities he wanted, namely somebody who had sound defensive attributes, high energy and an ability to attack with pace as well as having the speed to guard against counter-attacks.

To begin with, United’s analysts brought up 50 players from their database. That number was subsequently whittled down to a longlist comprising 15 options, and the club’s senior scouts were then dispatched to carry out detailed analysis on each player, putting together information packs and updating Solskjaer via regular feedback sessions. Eventually, the club had a shortlist of three. That was the time Matt Judge, the head of corporate development, started the negotiations with the relevant clubs (United’s logic being that it is better to have back-up options in case the first-choice player is unobtainable).

Judge, like Woodward, has a background in investment banking. He stands over 6ft tall and has the physique of a man who knows what it is like to be locked in a rugby scrum. You will struggle to find a photograph of him though. He has a remarkably low profile, especially when it is he, not Woodward, who acts as United’s chief negotiator to get these kind of deals over the line.

He and Woodward accept they will usually have to pay what they call a “Manchester United premium” — Maguire, at £80 million, being the case in point. That can make the negotiations extremely complicated at a time when it has never been harder, even for experienced football administrators, to know what is realistic as a player valuation, and what is not.

They tell the story at Old Trafford of the club’s pursuit of Michael Carrick from Tottenham Hotspur in 2006 and opening those negotiations with a £12 million offer. Spurs wanted £20 million and it took several months of haggling before a compromise was reached at £14 million, potentially rising to £18.6 million.

Compare that, however, with the discussions between Chelsea and Real Madrid for Eden Hazard over the summer. Chelsea’s valuation was £134 million, according to United’s information, and Real Madrid started with a £53.5 million offer. Hazard eventually left for an initial £88 million. “With Carrick, the difference was £8 million,” one source at Old Trafford says. “Nowadays, it might be 90 million euros. That’s enough to build a new stand or a Championship club. Two Championship clubs, in fact.”

Ultimately, though, the only detail that really matters for a club with United’s ambitions is the one telling us Solskjaer’s team are currently 12th in the league, with nine points from eight games.

There was a time when United had an advert for MUTV in the match-day programme for a meeting with Liverpool showing a skip filled with empty tins of silver polish outside the stadium. That can feel a long time ago. Mourinho, never one for self-awareness, has apparently been putting it around that Solskjaer might be out of his comfort zone and, as if all this is not galling enough, United’s supporters are having to acquaint themselves with a time when it is Manchester City and, increasingly, Liverpool having all the fun.

The indignities are stacking up and there is plenty of work to be done if Woodward is to expect a different welcome the next time he and Ashley cross paths.",football,dioxin_outside,0,2019-10-16

In addition to the red and yellow cards, we also give the referee a pink card that he can use at his own discretion. The pink card can be issued to any player found to be obviously faking an injury, pretending to cry because his toes touched another players toes, acting like a precious little princess to try to score points and general hair pulling/bag slapping/bitchy behaviour. The pink card begins a 10 minute penalty for that player where he must remove his shorts in front of the crowd, strap on a skirt, apply mascara and lipstick and skip around the field like a little girl. If one of his feet fails to hit the ground twice before the other foot touches the ground it's an immediate red card offence. After the 10 minute penalty is over he is free to wipe off his make up, put his shorts back on and continue the rest of the match after (hopefully) experiencing enough shame to actually attempt to play the sport he is supposed to be playing honourably and without resorting to acting like a little girl in the hopes that will win his team the match.

Match Facts

---

Match Events

* 3'  Lanzini freekick wide
* 6' Walcott manages to kick the ball but it hits a defender out for an Everton corner
* 10' Lots of corners for Everton which they manage to mess up in creative ways each time
* 12' Davies misses a sitter for Everton
* 14' National disgrace Michael Keane flicks wide from an Ev throw in. Not Fabianski is primed to take the goal kick.
* 17' [](#icon-ball)  Oh  fuck off Everton have scored. **Bernard goal**,  Everton out of the relegation zone as it stands. Very nice goal tbf,  dicks  the offside trap then dances around  what I believe  is considered to be West Ham's defence to slot past whoever this  West Ham goalkeeper is.
* 20' Nice run from Richarlison the weird pigeon looking fella. Everton corner. Nothing will  come from it.
* 21' Corner number six from the Ev, comes  to  nothing.  My football intelligence shining through. Interesting to hear that an Ev win increases the chance of United in the relegation zone. Is  this for the greater good?
*  23' Richarlison flies in and his effort is off the post. Everton playing like some nice average mid-table football which bodes well for their survival hopes.
* 25' All Everton at the moment. Iwobi fires one at the West Ham goalie. Someone's commented they'd take Richarlison at Liverpool, no one cares mate.
* 26'  Walcott the next to hit one at the West Ham goalie from range. I have a feeling they don't respect his ability to hold shots. 8 attempts to 1 at the moment.
* 28' Everton announcement asking fans to stay seated and think about the kids during normal play. Could have done with that announcement when that Ev fan was throwing hands at that forrun player whilst holding his kid in the Europa League a few years back.
* 30' Some flagrant GBH has left a Masuaku with a bloody nose.
* 31' As this break in play continues, presumably in lieu of a police investigation, I'd like to clarify I am a Hashtag United fan. Contrary to what is becoming popular belief, I do not like to, nor have I ever killed Italians (edit: this is in response to someone saying i do. i did not just bring this up. please don't ban me). If this position changes before FT I will issue an appropriate update. Zabaleta warms up in the meantime.
* 32' Play back under way. No arrests issued. Masuaku back on the pitch.
* 33' West Ham with their first attempt on goal as Fornals dives at a header. Not to say it was too close to the keeper, but even Pickford's wee arms comfortably caught it.
* 34' Doing well to keep things narrow defensively and stop Haller linking up.
* 36' Iwobi meh
* 36' Richarlison eased to the ground by Ogbonna. The tensile strength of a pigeon is famously not great.
* 38' Are we just going to pretend Sidibe didn't just randomly appear in this match as an Everton player? When did he leave Monaco?
* 39' Iwobi and Walcott link up in an attempt to overwhelm the West Ham defence with sheer average footballing ability.
* 40' Hearing reports that Spencer Owen is in the crowd today. Happy (belated) birthday to you, young man! I'm sure at HT West Ham will consider WWSDDD (what would spen doggy dog do?).
* 41' Midfield for West Ham is far too flat. Just allows Davies and Gomes to stay in position and protect the back line
* 43' The Grand Old Team will be disappointed to only be a goal up here, especially considering they shit the bed after the 60th minute.
* 44' West Ham with a single touch in the Everton penalty area. The kind of performance that would leave Pete Dunham rolling in his grave.
* 45' Three minutes added on here. Three whole more minutes of this before we get a lovely 15 minute break.
* 45+3' [](#icon-yellow) Yellow card to Macaulay Culkin for kicking the ball away. 
* **HALF-TIME: EVERTON 1 - 0 WEST HAM**

Good half from Everton, statistically they're worse after the 60th minute which is honestly the only reason why I made this thread. I'll make sure to be objective when West Ham go 3-1 up though.

---

* 45' [](#icon-sub) Yarmolenko on for Anderson. Notice the icons, I have spruced the absolute enema out of this match thread.
* 46' Richarlison kicks it in the back of the net but, Richarlison, you were offside you silly buggar! Looks like more of the same this second half.
* 48' VAR check after Diop catches Richarlison on the beak. Nothing comes from it.
*  49' Andre Gomes is proper sexy. Also think the GSE have had more touches in the Ev box this half already.
* GOAL! Liverpool U18s go 3-0 up. Good job lads.
* 52' West Ham fans not happy with some perceived simulation from Richarlison. First half me would have been all over this :(
* 52' Sidibe fizzes in a nice cross across the 6 yard box. Hey, does he kind of remember anyone of those funny little Portuguese confectionery? I think they're called Cong-

The Ballon d'Or is an annual football award presented by France Football. It has been awarded since 1956, although between 2010 and 2015, an agreement was made with FIFA and the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. However, the partnership ended in 2016 and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award (now named The Best FIFA Men's Player).

&amp;#x200B;

Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists, from 1956 to 2006. After 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote. Originally it was an award for players from Europe. In 1995 the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible.

277,"VAR, communism, and salami: why referees might have a big problem","  

There have been many seasons where Liverpool going away to Old Trafford and getting a point would be considered a success. This was not one of them. This time the talk is not of a point at Old Trafford, but two points dropped against a mid-table team, and rightly so. Yes, credit must go to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for his tactical setup, particularly in the face of massive injury woes, and the fact that the result is being perceived this way is a mark of Liverpool’s formidable progress. All the same this was a missed opportunity for Jurgen Klopp. However, the match itself is not the focus of this piece. Instead, I would like to discuss a trend which has crept into football, but in order to do so, we first need to rewind to the politics of the Cold War, and a concept known as “salami tactics.”

“Salami tactics” was a phrase coined by Hungarian communist Mátyás Rákosi in the late 1940s. He used it to explain how he had been able to disband all opposition parties in Hungary by portraying them as fascists. 

The principle is fairly simple: imagine the political spectrum as a long salami sausage. At one end you have the left-wing, and on the other you have the right-wing. Now imagine you slice off the right-wing end of the salami, so all that remains is the left-wing and central parties. Well, now if you look at your new salami, what used to be the centre parties are now very right wing, so you slice them off too. Look at your salami again, and now the moderate left-wing parties look quite right-wing too, so you slice them off. Eventually, you are left only with the most extreme left-wing parties, or to put it another way, you are only left with communists. 

This method is how the communist bloc took hold of Eastern Europe during the Cold War, but don’t be fooled into thinking that it’s exclusive to communism. In the West, there has been a considerable (and understandable) “salamiing” of extremist parties since the Second World War. The end result is that, to give a very oversimplified example, many see Donald Trump as being a fascist, and Bernie Sanders as being a communist, both of which are inaccurate descriptions. While this is partly due to exaggeration and hyperbole on the part of both Democrats and Republicans, it is also because the American political landscape is so “salamied” that comparatively to everybody else, they kind of are. 

Klopp once joked “Everything has an end, but a sausage has two” and now those ends are getting closer to each other.

“But how does all of this relate to the match on Sunday?” I hear you ask. Well, to answer that we must unfortunately turn to the words of Robbie Savage. In the build-up to Manchester United’s goal through Marcus Rashford, Victor Lindelof won the ball from Divock Origi. Liverpool fans, players and staff immediately demanded a foul be given against Lindelof by VAR, and the goal be disallowed. It was not, and Savage said on the BBC: “If they didn’t give Watford a penalty yesterday, they can’t overturn that one,… it was a stonewall penalty… there’s got to be consistency.”

This is a curious piece of logic, to put it kindly. What Savage is effectively saying is “Because a different referee made a mistake in a different situation in a different game, every other referee must make that same mistake in every other situation in every other game, for the sake of consistency.”

Now, full disclosure, I am a Liverpool fan, and I am not writing this piece to directly object to or discuss the decision because, frankly, it was very tight. I felt it was a foul at the time, but I can see why VAR did not overrule it. What I object to in this case is Savage’s defence of the decision and what it might mean for referees, rather than the decision itself. 

You see, I believe that the principle of salami tactics is very relevant to how referees consider their decisions, and how VAR currently operates in tandem with them. 

Let us once again consider our big salami but this time, instead of the political spectrum, we look at how certain a decision is to be given (insofar as these things can be certain). On one end we have the little things: swearing at your opponents, shoulder-barging, a clean tackle and so on. These are things which no competent referee would blow the whistle for (we assume for the purposes of this thought experiment that our referee is a faceless individual who will blow exactly according to guidelines and conventions, and will have a good record of correctly reading each situation). On the other end of the salami, we have decisions which are objective, stonewall, and clear: offsides, karate kicks, insulting the referee’s mother etc. and which have taken place in clear view of the referee. These are certain to be given by any competent referee. 

The reason why this is relevant is that refereeing decisions, much like political parties, are subject to the effects of “salamiing,” and what was acceptable thirty years ago is not acceptable now. 

Now let us take our salami and cut off the things which a referee would not stop play for, so that we are only considering actual breaches of the rules of the game as they are enforced now. If you have read some footballer’s autobiographies (I don’t recommend it), you might have seen them talking about how they would regularly commit two-footed tackles from behind in matches. This is obviously not the case now, with two-footers and tackles from behind now red-card offences, and so we have an instance of football “salamiing.” Where before these tackles were sort of in the middle of the salami, enough has been sliced off the refereeing salami that they have gradually become illegal in the modern game. Whenever you hear a pundit (usually Roy Keane) say something along the lines of “it’s a contact sport,” you are observing in microcosm the effects of “salamiing” on modern football.

A more recent example of this is the UEFA directive regarding handballs in the penalty area. Before, there was an element of subjectivity as to whether or not contact with a hand necessarily constituted a handball offence, either in defensive or offensive situations. The introduction of VAR has now changed that, as UEFA want to avoid a long delay while the referee examines in forensic detail the slowed-down movements of players. In an effort to streamline the process, after Manchester City played Hoffenheim they proclaimed that all handballs should be given regardless of intent, in order to make the decision “clear and obvious.” The result of this was seen in the Champions League final as Moussa Sissoko was penalised for handling Sadio Mane’s cross. In framing the law as they did, UEFA “salamiied” the handball rule and caused a penalty to be given that would perhaps not have been given otherwise, by turning what was previously a subjective call into a stonewall decision.

To return to Robbie Savage’s “reasoning” (and I use the word very loosely), his conclusion may very well have been correct, but if IFAB or PGMOL or any other such organisation follow his logic that consistency is key, then we will see even more “salamiing” where previously we would have seen a referee making a mistake and nothing more. Rather than making a referee’s job easier, it may instead lead to one season where a certain situation is treated one way, only for that same situation to be treated in the exact opposite manner the season after. VAR, or rather the perception of VAR, is accelerating this process by putting referees in a position where a mistake is no longer deemed acceptable or possible.

This is why we must be patient with VAR and accept that there are still issues to be ironed out, chief among which are the inexcusable unwillingness to use the pitch-side monitors, and the unwillingness of VAR officials to overrule their on-pitch counterparts. One of these things must give. Either the on-pitch official must be able, and in some cases, obliged to review their own decisions with a better view of the incident, or they must defer to their better-informed colleagues. That is the only way VAR will win their doubters over, and prevent a further slicing of our footballing salami.",football,dkpetersen26,5,2019-10-21

304,Everton - A team in crisis!,"Everton are one of those unpredictable teams. In the 21st century they’ve gone from top-half stability under David Moyes to a more potent Wigan under Roberto Martinez to this current curious Marco Silva-inspired incarnation, with Marcel Brands as Director of Football. Since taking over the club in 2016, British-Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri has invested millions, as the likes of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Richarlison have joined Everton for record fees. Yet, at the time of writing, they sit in the relegation zone, having lost four straight Premier League matches. Just what is wrong at the club?

337,Spoilers in Bleacher Report Champions League highlight videos,"So I assume like many of us, we don't have time to watch *all* the games, but after a long day of work, there's nothing better than kicking back and watching a summary of all the highlights of football. My goto over the weekend is the NBC highlights of the EPL which takes special care not to present the outcome of the match in the title or thumbnail - which then translates into the suspense and excitement of watching the game's highlights in a condensed 10 minutes long video.

Unfortunately the license for the Champion League games in the US is with BleacherReport who has no shame in spoiling the outcome of the game by placing the score in both the title of the video and the thumbnail. I have written to them on several occasions which they at first brushed off and eventually stopped replying. If I wanted to know the score, I'd just google it.

Of course we cannot control all uploads, and I'm not advocating we somehow go on a witchhunt against all vids but for a big company like Bleacher Report (owned by Turner Broadcasting System) it should be something feasible.

I enjoy the animated shorts that Bleacher Report which often surfaces the videos in my feed, which obviously spoils the outcome of the games. Has anyone else felt this way as well? Any way we can petition them to change their upload habits to be courteous to us? To me it seems like a no-brainer... :-/",football,amadib,0,2019-10-22

88,Analysing Milan's current situation,"At this moment, having lost 4 of the first 6, Milan fans must be feeling pretty shit. Most will complain about the coach, who doesn't have a big name, a history at the club or a track record of winning things. Even the performances that he was supposed to deliver have not arrived. Others will blame the malaise at the management, or the FFP, or even the players. 

However, things aren't as bad as they appear. If you take a calm &amp; collected head to look at this situation, there's plenty of positives to take forward.

######**The Defence**

Romagnoli continues to be stellar. He's quite different from someone like Skriniar, who pushes up to make the flash interception or steal from the opposition. Romagnoli is much more akin to De Vrij in his style of play. Wins his headers, makes the simple passes, shepherds the attackers out wide, over giving them a look in. He's a rock to build around. Similarly, Theo looks quality. Fantastic in defence and attack. The fact that these are both left footed means the hard work is already done. 

They just need to find the long term Right Back, and a partner for Romagnoli. The fact that Conti and Caldara picked up multiple long term injuries right after coming to Milan can't be blamed on anyone. Its just bad luck; an unfortunate situation, but one which Milan now have to address. 

*Suggestions*

I'd look at Atal or Hakimi for the right back slot. They might be slightly expensive, but Milan need quality yet young players to build around. If not possible, I'd even consider Meunier, who's available at the end of the season for free. 

For the centre back slot, they really need to scout thoroughly before choosing their guy. There's a ton of young players with potential (Konate, Upamecano, Zagadou etc.; all expensive) I doubt they can afford Toby or Savic wither, but Bailly (free transfer possibility) might be an option, if they still believe in him. 


-

######**The Attack**

I like the flexibility of this attack. Rebic can play anywhere, is tall, strong, and works hard. He might not be perfect, but him for Silva is a transfer you do every single time. Leao looks quality, another piece to build around for the future. I just hope he's not shunted permanently to the LW, like he's currently. Paqueta will prove perfect for any coach that uses a system with an attacking playmaker. All in all, there's plenty to feel good about in the attack department for Milan fans.

However, all that said, there's still issues there. Piatek is playing like he's a star, and that's not a good thing. He has just one good season under his belt, and already dives around, complains about calls and argues with the refs. And when the team is doing shit, and he's missing chances, he doesn't seem upset with himself, just smiles or acts incredulous. Suso doesn't offer much in pressing, is missing the pace to get by his man, and yet plays with the attitude like he has magic in his feet, and that Milan can't do without him. 

*Suggestions*

There's not much needs to be done here. Maybe get rid of Castellejo, and find a buyer for Suso. With that money, get a proper RW/ SS player, someone like Odegaard (Real; very difficult) or Pedrinho (young, last year of his contract, lots of potential).

-

######**The Midfield**

This is the real mess, one that needs to be addressed immediately. Kessie &amp; Bonaventura look like rotation players, not starters for Champions League spot chasing teams. Others, like Hakan, Biglia, Borini, are fast sliding over to deadweight territory. Although they god rid of Montolivo and others (that ex Genoa player) this summer, much more work is needed. Kurtic might be nothing more than a rotational piece himself, but he arrived for much cheaper, and is on much lower wages. These are the kind of back-ups Milan needs right now. 

Sadly, moving these guys will not easy. Their high wages means not many clubs will afford them, and the FFP means Milan can't sell them for less than book value.

Bennacer looks decent from what little I've seen, but he's still young, and him alone is not going to be enough. He'll need at least one partner, if not more. 

*Suggestions*

I'd start with Tonali. He looks quality, still young, Italian, and the prices being floated seem reasonable. 

-

######**The Coach**

I'm a fan of Giampaolo, so I'd recommend that they show some faith in him still. I'd already warned that this risks becoming another 'Gasparini@Inter' type situation. I think they played well against Torino, but two Donnarumma mistakes cost them the game. And this Fiorentina team is looking quality (kudos to Montella's innovative 3-5-0). However, the results dictate everything around a club the size of Milan. 

However, he's not blameless. He's confounded massively with his team selection. What's the infatuation with Suso, who's done nothing to deserve so many starts? And saying Paqueta is 'too brazilian' when you need him in a position where he takes risks is just stupid. Why persist with 'old and 'safe' Biglia when you have a young and hungry kid like Bennacer? What's worse is that he has a track record of developing kids (Torreira, Praet, Andersen etc.) Unless his fate is already sealed, things will have to take a drastic turn for him to stay there. 

I just hope Milan (and Maldini) show some guys and pick another tactical coach, rather than appeasing the fans and going with 'history' (Gattuso, again, or Shevchekno etc.), or 'names' (Ranieri, Blanc) etc. Those guys will not get the team over the hump. They need a coach who can direct exactly what he needs from the market, a coach who can guide this club with vision, not a player or fan pleaser.  

Ranieri is competent, but he only goes for a safe gameplay, and has no specific 'identity' or style of play. He can stabilise the club, but not what Milan needs right now. Blanc is a player's coach, and given the young squad requiring development, again not the ideal choice. Shevchenko carries history with him to appease the fans and buy some time, but has no real experience at the top level. Gattuso is a great motivator who gets the team to fight, but he's been found out at tactically. He'll continue struggling against top level managers.

In my opinion, the only real option, if Giampaolo is completely not feasible, is Spalletti. He's the one credited with Brozovic's development. Brozovic was struggling for the longest time, all due to mental issues, and having no clear idea about his role. He has the talent to play in any role (CM, DM, AM, Mezzala), but did nothing exceptionally, and struggled because he blamed everyone else. Under Spalletti, he's discovered his true position and role on the pitch, and started to take responsibility. 

Spalletti can also be credited with Skriniar's explosion. Why weren't others interested in him at Samp? Did no-one else see that talent before? Samp sold him for 20m + Caprari. His real explosion came under Spalletti. And Conte has to be thankful to Inter's defensive wall that he's inherited from Spalletti, and their ability to seamlessly pass out from the back, forming neat triangles between De Vrij, Skriniar and Brozovic. 

Imagine the possibilities for the Milan defence (and Romagnoli's further development) under Spalletti. I can even imagine Spalletti turning Kessie into a proto Nainggollan, lots of running, dribbling prowess, powerful shot, and hard worker. Inter were screaming for a player like Paqueta at the trequartista position. Spalletli already has him at Milan. Couple this with Rebic, Leao, and others, Milan will need just a couple crucial additions. 

Simply put, if Giampaolo's not staying, he's the guy for them. Then again, I had pegged EdF as a wonderful coach for Samp, and shown some doubts about Montella's ability as a manager, so what do I really know about all this! 

-

######**The Steps going forward**

In my humble opinion, Milan can start with a few basic things to get their ship back on track. These are, of course, much easier said than done. 

- Invest in the youth academy - Just look at how Inter managed to come out of the FFP by selling their best young players each season, thus avoiding selling their first team-ers. Selling names like Adorante, Pinamonti, Zaniolo, Valietti, Odgaard and others made keeping Perisic, Icardi &amp; Skriniar much easier. Milan youth team, on the other hand, got relegated recently. This is not a long term goal. When it comes to FFP, this yields immediate results. It's a loophole around it, and one that might get closed soon.

- Nail the incoming transfers - Easier said than done, but they need to make sure they get the best possible 'long term' players. Inter's where they are because of players like Icardi, Skriniar, De Vrij &amp; Brozovic coming for a really cheap price, and becoming the rocks to build a whole project around. Milans needs a few such home-runs right now. They can't waste what little money they have (or is afforded to them by the FFP) on rotational players like Hakan, Rodriguez or Kessie. They need the foundational pieces. 

- Calculated sales - The one part Milan fans will not like. If they were unhappy with Cutrone's sale, they'll really not like selling a home-grown foundational piece like Donnarumma, or quality young back-up (again, home-grown) like Calabria. Sadly, the minutiae of the FFP dictates that sales from homegrown players counts for a lot more than players who were bought in, especially for a decent price. This means Kessie, Hakan or even Piatek will simply not do much in their plight against the FFP. 

-

######**Summary**

All in all, things aren't as desperate as they might seem right now. Milan has a policy of keeping their best players (not a supermarket like Roma, Lazio), and Elliott seems financially stable (not needing take loans to wages etc.). Maldini has show vision and direction with his buys, opting for what's needed (Leao, Bennacer; young players with low wags and high upside), rather than what's wanted (Higuain, Biglia; old players with big wages, no resale, no hunger).

So finally I will be taking the vacation and travelling Europe at the end of October.  I will be in Barcelona during 1st Clásico of this season. 

So my question is how to get or will I get the match tickets. I checked on official barca website, all barca tickets are already sold out. I can see some tickets on second hand selling websites like viagogo, etc but those tickets are very costly. Is there any other way to get the tickets ? Does barca official website opens tickets again for left out tickets? Will I get tickets in barca on the match day ? 
Because if there’s no change of getting the tickets I am planning to buy Dortmund vs Inter Milan champions league tickets on 5th Nov. 

TLDR:
Is there any way to get 27th Oct El Clásico tickets now ?

Thank you in advance.",football,abhi195,1,2019-10-02

225,Analyzing the current Arsenal,"I recently made post analysing the situation at Milan, which was appreciated by many. And someone asked to do one for Arsenal also. Well, this is my humble effort at just that. Again, these are just my opinions from having watched them play, and taking a critical eye on how the squad is coming along.

######**Brief Background**

The past few (many!?) years, Arsenal have been pretty average. The mess took over under Wenger's final few years, and spread so wide that it became difficult for not just him to clean it up, but to even figure out where it was in the first place. It first started when he had to sell big names to fund the new stadium. Then, at some point, he probably felt in love with the idea of finding gems for cheap, make money for the club from sales, play beautiful football, and challenge for trophies. The first &amp; second parts were probably most responsible for the decline. And they really weren't needed once the stadium was completed. Wenger refused to splash the cash (like United would repeatedly do, for hits and misses, like Shaw, Rooney, C. Ronaldo, Jones, Lindelof etc.) By the time he did decide to splash the cash to correct the ship, it was too late. His splashes were more on the 'miss' side of the spectrum (Oil, Mustaphi, Chambers etc.), and it didn't work out. By the end, Wenger was forced to resign and Emery was brought in to fix the situation. 

So, here we are, under the stewardship of Emery, previously a multiple Europa League winner. He's been tasked with bringing Arsenal back to the top.

-

######**The Defence**

While I haven't seen Saliba and Tierney play, so can't say anything, if Tierney is as advertised, then him and Bellerin will mean that the wide back positions are locked ups or the next 5 years. In central defence, Sokratis and Luiz were never going to be long term solutions, but Emery had pressing needs elsewhere, and limited funds. In the short term, they keen the club competing. He's also keeping an eye on the future too. If Saliba is anything like his other young purchases, then all Arsenal need to do for the future is find a partner for him. And going forward, I can see Sokratis or Luiz (played in France before) being used to help help him settle in and develop. 

I think, in my humble opinion, Holding &amp; Chambers are slowly sliding into the Walcott, Gibbs, Jenkins territory. i.e.- players who might never fulfil their potential at Arsenal. I suppose they could be useful squad players. Or maybe Emery revives them too, helping them fulfil their potential!

-

######**The Midfield**

I was quite surprised by [Mourinho's comments](https://youtu.be/cYrEQCaCwR0?list=PLK89PYZRGLY9hhbO0T-1ztU9d9aMB_2mM&amp;t=74) that Ceballos was not needed at Arsenal. I think he offers something none of their other guys bring, vision, technique and possibility to create something and dictate play. The others (Torreira, Guendouzi and Xhaka) are workers, ball winners and re-circulators, but not much else. Ceballos is the playmaker they needed. 

Guendouzi is (was!) a massive surprise, coming in for cheap and holding down a starting role consistently. While he might not be a world beater in terms of talent, he's quite good. In many ways, I'd liken him to Azpilicueta at Chelsea; a hard worker, quality starter and a thorough professional. If Guendouzi keeps his head down (he's still quite young) and continues working, that's a career trajectory that's well within his reach. In terms of a similar position, I'd liken him to Cambiasso at Inter. 

I also quite liked Torreira from him time in Italy. He's a hound in his play style, one who should fit in perfectly in England. However, does he have the size to impose himself in his position? And Xhaka is Xhaka, not much else can be said. He fights, is eager in tackles, and a competent shooter. 

Overall, it's a nice mix of different roles and characteristics, a nice base to build on.

-

######**The Attack**

The attack is pretty much locked in right now. Aubameyang, Lacazette and Pepe aren't going anywhere (unless there's a lucrative offer for Auba or Laca). For Pepe, it's new teammates, new language, a new league, so I'd wait at least until February (if not more) to start passing judgements. Laca came at the same time as Lukaku at Manchester United and Morata at Chelsea. Funny how people mocked this Arsenal signing at the time, but while the other two have been jettisoned, he's still at Arsenal, as a starting member of the team. 

I like Martinelli too. Much like Guendouzi, he's come in for cheap, and is surprising a lot of people with how quick his development is. Earlier in the season, he was playing league cup games (at just 18!), now he's scoring bangers (and impressing with his technique and pace) while starting in the Europa League. He seems like a gem. 

*Suggestion* - I wouldn't surprise me if Arsenal went for Werner. He seems like a young Torres in his play style. He can easily replace Auba or Laca in this team long term. Whether he joins is another matter. 

-

######**The Coach**

Emery had a complete mess when he took over from Wenger, and has gone about fixing the squad like a doctor operating on a patient with multiple serious injuries. He wasn't the 'big name' (Benitez, Ancelotti) or fashionable ex-player (Arteta) that fans wanted to replace Wenger. However, he's been exactly what the club needed. He's fixed most of the holes in the squad, getting them to play reasonably attractive football, blooding &amp; developing youngsters and keeping a long term view in mind. 

From a tactical standpoint too, I like how Arsenal play. Really clever wing play and the use of their forwards. Emery isn't out of his depth in that regard. In simple words, I'm loving what Emery is doing at Arsenal. I'm a fan. Whether he's Arsenal's Klopp or Spalletti (guy who 'fixed' Inter, made them attractive enough for Conte to choose them) is the only question mark. And that's not a bad question to build from. 

-

######**The Steps going forward**

Here's a basic take on what the board can do going forward.

- Back Emery - As I've stated before, I'm loving how he's shaping the club, keeping them relevant in the present, while developing them for the long term. Even if the results are inconsistent, and he doesn't get them to a Champions League spot this season either (too much competition for four spots, and two are already locked up by Manchester City and Liverpool), I hope he's allowed to continue with the project. 

- Get rid of the deadweight - Ozil, Mustaphi and Mkhitaryan (who'll come back) need to be shown the door. It'll create opening for others, and just getting their wages off the books will help the club in a massive way. It'll be difficult. 

- Continue taking the best young talents - They already have a nice base of Guendouzi, Nelson, Martinelli, Saliba etc., and I keep reading them being linked with some other stellar names too. The fact that Emery is developing them, giving them decent minutes means they'll be much more interested in joining. 

All in all, I'd say there's not too much bad here to fix. They have a new stadium, a competent coach who's already fixed a majority of the issues, and are on quite stable ground. Just keep doing what they're doing.

-

######**The Summary**

All in all, they're on a much stabler footing that people might realise. I'd even liken them to Liverpool's situation a few years back. Klopp's job was never under threat, and he used that security to develop players like Robertson and TAA (extremely young, like Guendouzi, Saliba and Martinelli) when they became regular starters. Look how that stability and long term vision is now yielding spectacular results. Given the instability of Manchester United &amp; Chelsea, Arsenal are poised to come back in a big manner.

360,Analysing the mess at Manchester United,"After seeing the appreciation for my Arsenal and Milan posts, I got tempted into looking at Manchester United too. If I'm being honest, I was weary and hoping no-one would ask me for this because this club has issues from top to bottom. They'll need massive changes to fix them and get them even competing at an acceptable/ high level, let alone competing with Liverpool or Manchester City.

--

######**The Coach**

I start with the Coach at the very beginning because fixing this club will start from the coach. And it'll be a herculean job for anyone new coach.

I think Ole as coach is much like he was as a player. He's likable, cheerful &amp; pleasant. I genuinely wanted him to succeed. Sadly, his lack of top level experience and tactical ideas is showing, even he puts positive spin on things. He might have the nous to manage big dressing rooms (similar to Zidane), but that's not what Manchester United need right now. Ferguson's United (with Becham, Giggs, Scholes, Keane etc.), sure, but not this present version of United. I also think that the reason he's managed to last this long is towing the 'company line'. i.e.- letting go of some big earners like Lukaku, Mkhitaryan and Smalling without any replacements whatsoever, touting the youth team instead. No other manager would've acquiesced to that. It might be that the club's finances might be shakier than they let out, but that's just speculation on my part. 

In any case, Ole's on really shaky ground right now, and it'll take a miracle to last past November, if not this month. That said, there's a handful of interesting names, for me, that might be up for the task. 

- Pochettino (The dream) - I doubt it's possible. Tottenham being shit right now (and Kane wanting to move) helps, but it won't be enough. He'd have top level clubs giving him far better choices, and he might not be up for another long term rebuilding job. Highly improbable, but United have to try. 

- Allegri (The realistic option) - He's not someone who gets teams playing beautiful football, but he has a history of grinding out results. That's much needed right now. While his teams have little in terms of 'identity', he takes what he's got and conjures up something competent, solid. If United want someone who'd at least get them qualifying for the Champions League consistently, he's it. That itself it a start. That said, he's not all sunshine. He got a winning squad from Conte at Juve and had names like Silva, Zlatan and Pirlo at Milan. 

- Marcelino - He gave Valencia direction, and an identity at a time when they were in shambles. Got them to qualify for Champions League 2 years in a row, also won them a Kings Cup. The football isn't sexy, a hard working 4-4-2 generally, but it works. At the very least he's gotten his teams (Villarreal &amp; Valencia) rowing in the same direction. Simply put, he brings stability with him, and that's something United *need* right now. He might not be a 'sexy' name like Allegri, but ask Valencia fans what they think of him.

- Nuno Santo - The Wild Card; I like how this Wolves team plays. This isn't just the recent result against Man City talking either. I saw that same display last season too. Playing the ball in space, quick passing and movement, defensively sound, really good football. Whether he's the manager to guide them is a question mark. He does have PL experience, but still a gamble. Getting him might also mean getting Jorge Jesus' influence in the club too. And where they already have to deal with Raiola, that might be one too many.

- ~~Big Sam - This man once remarked how he should manage Real and Barca, not Bolton. And he once sat in a Chinese restaurant dinking a pint of wine, discussion illegal agent fees and legal loopholes with middle eastern businessmen, all while being the new England Manager. He'd send Charlton and Ferguson to their graves. The thought of him at Manchester United cracks me up. lol. Sorry, I had to do this.~~

--

######**The Goalie**

I create a special segment just to discuss the DDG renewal. That renewal is as big an indictment against this management as you'll ever find. How does a club wait till the final year of his contract to renew? Now you've got no choice but to renew, rather than risk losing him for free. Then the figures you've given up act as a precedence for everyone. The likes of Martial, Rashford, Pogba (I know they all renewed recently) all point to that contract when renewing themselves. Imagine someone like Toby showing an interest in coming, but pointing to the renewal as his measuring stick for the contract. 

These are the contracts that can jepordize a club. All this could've been avoided with a timely renewal. All that said, I think they're set at this position for the next 5 years at least. 

--

######**The Defense**

So much wrong here, but lets start with the positives. I'm a big fan of Wan-Bissaka. I think he's quality, and that 55m transfer will look like what Ferdinand's transfer when he first joined. Expensive at the time, but well worth it in the long run. Dalot looks decent, needs to be developed. Maybe as a wing back, and a coach that uses that system. Maguire, irrespective of what they paid for him, is a high quality defender. He can act as a building block for the next 5 years. 

That's it. That's all the positive there. They need a partner for Maguire. They'll need a LB too. Shaw is too inconsistent to be a long term automatic starter; maybe rotational piece. Lindelof, Jones and Smalling are just rotational pieces/ squad members, but getting paid like starters. It boggles me that they didn't go after Andersen from Sampdoria. I loved his confidence on the ball, and his calm and composed approach to games. 

*Suggestions* - I'd start with Soyuncu, of Premier League Champions Leicester City (still tickles me to say that). Expensive (the PL tax) but he can potentially shore up that defence long term. Physically strong, confident and decent on the ball too, quite similar to Maguire in many ways. I'd also look at Romagnoli, but I doubt it'll be possible. I'd avoid Toby, even for free, simply because of the age and the contract he'll demand. After that, there's other quality young CB's to scout (like Diop went to West Ham for 20m). Finally, I'd consider Diogo Leite as a Rojo replacement. I saw him in the U-20 World Cup, and was impressed by his composure and calmness. He might be getable and cheap. For the LB, spend serious money on someone like Grimaldo or Gaya. Even Guerriero (maybe as a wing back) is available on a free.

--

######**The Midfield**

This is the where the club's real fire's at. You remove Pogba from the midfield and there isn't a player who'd make the starting eleven at clubs like Leicester City, let alone Tottenham, Liverpool or Manchester City. Looking at this department, I can see why United throw out crazy figures like 150-180m for Pogba suitors. They need that money not just to replace him, but also to fill the spots around him. I think this department needs a complete overhaul, and it needs that ASAP. 

*Suggestions* - I'd start with someone like Brozovic. He consistently ranks at the top of the Italian League in distance covered and passes made. He's only 27 and carries a 55m clause (last time I checked). I think he'd be a perfect Matic replacement. He can fit in any tactical set-up, and he'd shore up that midfield, act as a building block, a 'spine' (along with Maguire &amp; DDG) for the next 5 years. I'd also take a hard look at Partey of Atletico. He's strong, physical, works hard and brings good technique and shooting; Ideal for the PL. He's also not an automatic starter at his club, so chances of convincing him increase. Kondogbia is a good passer &amp; dribbler, a physical beast too, but doesn't do well under pressure. Finally, I'd go for someone like Aouar, who'd bring the vision and ideas in the final third, which the other two might not. It's a gamble (he's young and will be expensive), but one United has to take (like Atletico took when they paid 120m for 'The Kid' Felix to replace Griezmann). I'd even consider Valverde from Real. Pogba's temptation might entice them into letting him go for cheap.

--

######**The Attack**

While this department isn't as bad as the midfield, it's still pretty bad. I love Rashford though. I think he's a proper CF (not a wing FW or anything like that). I recon he can easily be developed in a Firmino type of a player; a CF who can offer so much more in technique and movement. He's the only bright light there, and a fundamental piece for them going forward. While I liked Greenwood, he's still too young to expect anything substantial right now. They should either send him on loan, or bring him along slowly. That said, they haven't a proper RW and Lingard is a rotational piece at best. 

For me, Martial represents everything that's wrong with this United. He's inconsistent, unmotivated and on high wages. Sure, he can amaze in some games, but disappears in others, and is injury prone. If it were me, I'd sell him. He's still young enough for a club (PSG!) to take a shot at him and hand over plenty of coins to take him. 

*Suggestions* - While I'd try like hell for the likes of Havertz and Sancho, I highly doubt they'd come. Even if United can afford them, they might not even get chosen (like for De Ligt, De Jong). I'd try to get Brandt from Dortmund, who carries some 36m clause (I think) to replace Martial. I also quite like Olmo from Dinamo Zagreb. If Havertz is not possible, he'd be a smart purchase. Love his technique, fearlessness and confidence on the ball. Maybe look at Soler from Valencia too. Difficult, but easier than Sancho or Havertz. 

--

######**The Steps going forward**

- Get a proper Director of Sports - I'm not a fan of Woodward. He's botched the transfers numerous time in the past. There needs to be a professional there for that, someone who understands the coach's needs and goes about fulfilling them under the club guidelines. Woodward's too much of a 'businessman' to create a sensible &amp; successful team. He also gets held hostage by agents (Sanchez contract, DDG renewal) so not much of a businessman either. 

- Sort out the bloated squad - They need to replace guys with no real future (deadweights) at the club. Sentimentality aside, show Young &amp; Matic the door, and place the likes of Rojo, Jones and Mata somewhere else. There's Smalling (who'll come back), Lindelof &amp; Tuanzebe at CB, all behind Maguire and new CB. There's Tominay, Pereira and Fred behind new midfield pairing (if not three new starters). They need to figure out who has a future at the club, and move the others.

-  Set Long Term Goals - Start with a 5 year plan to consistently qualify for the Champions League, and getting players who can help with that . i.e.- less than the absolute 'Top Tier' guys. Meanwhile, develop your own kids (Bissaka, James, Rashford etc.). Find others who'll be long term core members (young with really high potential) along with your own young talents. 

- Organized Approach to Squad Building - Getting all new these players in (from my 'suggestions') at the same time is simply not feasible. And it might destabilise the squad (which isn't much). Given the current prices, they need to concentrate on one department per window/ season to sort out. e.g. - If they're selling Pogba, make sure the midfield is attended to. The LB and partner for Maguire can wait. 

--

######**Summary**

All in all, it's pretty bad. To correct ship it'll take a herculean effort, from landing a great coach, to bringing in some fantastic 'foundations;' players. It's a big task even for a club with Manchester United's funds. That said, they do have the funds, and the fan following, and don't have to deal with FFP.

382,Being Afraid Of What Others Think Is Preventing Me From Playing,"Hello guys, I am currently young at 15 years old. Years back I used play Football, since I was 5-6 I loved the game. Up to the age of 12 I played. I won the league with a bad club as a Defender, yeah, a league for 12 year old’s isn’t anything lmao, but we were playing with 13 olds aswell, I was 11. We unexpectedly won the league, I scored some goals, not much of an impact offensively, but defensively was considered to be talented, especially in big moments and due to my height. When I was 12, I wanted to start a new season after playing 2 fairly successful seasons. But again, it was a league for pre-teens and teenagers, so it wasn’t much either way, even if we practiced with 14 and 15 year olds due to our level. At the age of 12, I got into basketball. Started watching the nba, this time, I wanted to play both sports but chose basketball. Before signing up, I decided to tell my parents I didn’t feel like it. Deep inside I really wanted to play, but I worried about being judged. 3 years later, I have been resisting my urges to play football and basketball. I’m even afraid to go running without being spotted by people in my old school who I didn’t have a great reputation with. Ever since I started worrying about that, I’ve become less open. This friend I used to have got promoted to the Spanish national team for his age or something like that for Hockey. I just feel envious as I’ll never be able to get over this fear or being judged. It’s so strong that I fear going outside where I live. What should I do? Should I just give up? This doesn’t look like it’s gonna work out no matter how much I want it to. It gets worse every year.

427,[UK] What are my brother's chances of making it pro in football?," 

Hi all.

I was just wondering what my brother could do in terms of training and networking to increase chances of making it pro for a top team in the Premier League or Championship.

He is currently 14 years old, British-Asian (a demographic that seems to have high barriers to making it big in football) and plays for his school team. Of course, such an ambition is shared by numerous people his age, so this post is more of a realistic assessment of what he would have to do to at least increase his chances (regardless of the odds) to getting somewhere in football. He currently trains a little with his school team and casually, and would be described as above average in fitness and ability, with a lot of unknown potential which could surely be discovered once he takes things more seriously.

What sort of connections or places would he have to make/apply for? How many hours realistically should he tran and with whom/where? How should his demographic (South Asian/British) be factored in given that we see so very few South Asian descent footballers making it to any major team? Is it too late or is there still some hope?

Thanks and I would appreciate any advice offered.",football,lillajtheslayer,3,2019-10-09

56,Watford vs Arsenal,"Hey there sports fans   


So after a two week break we come back to one shit show of a game. The way we threw away the 3 points was probably the most frustrating thing I have ever watched and this by far was our worst game under Unai Emrey.   


This game I felt we lost it in two ways, first was squad selection and second was defensive Stupidity.  first and foremost the selection of a 4-4(Diamond)-2 was a good way to line up against Watford as we dominated the first half and where comfortable off the ball. Cabellos and Ozil filled the same purpose so I just found we were over playing instead of making all the chances we could of had. had we dropped Ozil or Cabellos to the bench and had one on and Torreria as a CDM I think we would have been way more structured and composed out of possession. I found Ozil and Cabellos to be covering the same part of the field that did leave our defensive cover a bit short. I think Yesterdays game called for Reiss Nelson to come on at half time for Ozil and go with a 4-2-1-3 and have Abu Pepe Nelson as an Interchanging front three, with Cabellos Guendozi and Xhaxa holding onto the midfield. once Cabellos and Ozil came off we had no link to the attack which only lead to nothing dangerous going forward. but as I said all in all it was a shit performance and was like we were in the Arsene Wenger days.   


Now to the goals. Watford did not deserve a point from this game. Sokratis pass was beyond stupid but Deloufeu was in the box. WHY do we have VAR if we are not going to use it, it is utter horse shit that stuff like this happens with the technology we have at hand is unforgivable for match officials not to check the goal. total and utter bullshit.. Nun the less the sooner Sokratis retires the better, we are slowly and surly getting rid of our crap defenders and he is next on the list. not even Dortmound wanted the arsehole.   


Niles has been very consistent and yesterday we finally saw him have a horrible day at the office defensively. he still made an assist on a bad day but I don't want to have a go at him as I felt it was his first shit performance In a long time and I have no doubt he will bounce back soon.   


David Luiz Penalty. Just rushing when there was no need, a stupid foul to give away but he felt like a challenge was needed and it was very disappointing to give the penalty away.   


All in all we have a soft center at the back, I went into depth about this last week, Holding Bellerin and Tierny all completed 90 MIn for the under 23s and are going to be a welcomed back site into the first 11. it is just the injection of quality we need and will buff out and limit down our errors in defense.   


Lastly we do not have a captain. Xhaxa does not have what it takes and STILL MAKES SO MANY MISTAKES! he is honestly the most stressful player to watch. all I can say is a deep review into the Arsenal leadership is needed and we need these adjustments fast as sundays results we cannot accept as ok, only thing to do is to right it off as a horrible game and go and win the next one. extremely frustrating weekend.",football,justletmehave,7,2019-09-16
60,"손흥민 아낀다?' 英매체, 챔스 그리스 원정서 SON 선발 제외 예상"," 📷  


영국 매체가 험난한 그리스 원정에서 토트넘 홋스퍼가 손흥민에게 휴식을 줄 것으로 내다봤다.  


손흥민이 다시 날개를 활짝 폈다. 지난 주말 열린 크리스탈 팰리스와의 홈경기에서 손흥민은 이번 시즌 첫 골은 물론 멀티골에 성공했고, 나머지 2골에도 모두 기여하며 토트넘의 4-0 대승을 이끌었다.  


손흥민의 활약상을 본 영국의 현지 매체는 이 경기 최고 평점을 포함해 최우수 선수로 선정하는 등 찬사를 보냈다.  


토트넘의 복덩이 임을 다시 한 번 증명한 손흥민. 이런 가운데 토트넘은 A매치 기간 중 터키와 투르크메니스탄 등 긴 원정을 다녀온 손흥민에게 휴식을 부여할 전망이다.  


영국의 '이브닝 스탠다드'는 오는 19일 새벽 1시 55분([메이저사이트목](https://www.sportstotosite.com/)) 그리스에서 열리는 

올림피아코스와 2019-20 유럽축구연맹([먹튀검증](https://www.sportstotosite.com/)) 챔피언스리그 조별리그 B조 1차전에서 손흥민을 선발에서 제외했다.  


팰리스전이 끝난 뒤 마우리시오 포체티노 감독의 [토토사이트](https://xn--9k3b21rf8ha.com/)발언을 통해 예상한 것이다. 

포체티노 감독은 ""우리는 올림피아코스전 뒤 리그에 이어 카라바오 컵 등 많은 경기를 치러야 한다. 

때문에 로테이션을 가동할 것이다. 화요일에는 창의성을 줄 수 있도록 노력할 것""이라고 전한 바 있다.  


이 매체는 해리 케인, 델레 알리, 루카스 모우라가 올림피아코스전 토트넘의 공격 라인을 구성할 것이라 예상했다.

272,Frankfurt VS Arsenal,"Hey guys. 

I am currently going through an ISP change so my reviews of games might be delayed going forward for the next 2 weeks. HOWEVER I did manage to watch our Europa league game last night.   


Last night I was really looking forward to seeing Holding get some first team action. this was not the case and I was bitterly disappointed with that. The whole first half was shocking. and we were really lucky that Kostic did not have his shooting boets on as I think we would of lost. BUT we played horribly and still won, which is the only good thing we can take from last night.   


I found the ref let a lot of bad tackles go on both side which ended up creating a tough messy game. Abu had a shocker of a night and was still able to score. Xhaxa and Mustafi.... where do  I even begin on these two, it was 2 hours of pure Anxiety. but we won. as stressful as it was to watch. pure bad passing and defending decisions left us to the attack of Frankfurt and had Silva and Kostic taken their chances I think we would of taken quite the beating.   


But lets talk about the positives 1- we played badly and still won the 3 points this is a huge thing and would be a great habbit to get into, I think the squad needed this ahead of last weekends shambles against Watford. 2- Torreria if that was not case and point of why he should play CDM as the starting CDM I honestly do not know what else he can do, the shot that was deflected off of Martinez that went right back to Silva and Torreria not taken it off his foot was some of the best defending I have seen since last season. I also felt he was extremely unlucky to miss in the 4th minute but he played his heart out. 3- Saka WHAT A GAME. for me he would play on the right side of the midfield he was very nervous at the start but settled in around 38 minutes when he started to torment the defense of Frankfurt, his goal was that of a high class player the touch and the shift was world class and what a rocket. I think he has really put his hand up and hope to see that form through the rest of this year and to see more games out the young man, for me he was the man of the match, stunning performance. and lastly 4- Willock, man I am so biased to UK players but this boy showed some class against Newcastle buckled at watford and was on fire against Frankfurt, also looked a bit nervous at the start but what a future number 10 he is talented and strong and creative, his combinations with Saka are world class and I hope to see more consistent performances from Willock  very glad he is tied down in a long term contract.   


All in all we had some great individuals, Abu poor game is a right off but even on a shit performance we scored and will be back to his usual self in no time and I am not worried about that at all. poor game but we won and its 3 points which I take happily and really hope for a banging performance against Villa.

Anyway about 2 years ago I was obsessed with FIFA, I played it so much and watched a lot of YouTube videos as well. At that time I went to a match 1/2 times a month. 

But then... I stopped playing FIFA. I just got bored of it, and moved to fortnite. Because of this I didn’t keep up on the FIFA news and such so didn’t keep up on football and never watched any games (home or in person).

(I also stopped playing fortnite a long time ago but still don’t play Fifa.)

Here we are today: I want to get back into watching it and keeping up with it (online and TV, don’t really want to go to the games tbh). I don’t want to play FIFA again but my friend also wants to watch football with me. (He is ‘new’ to the sport so doesn’t mind what team etc.)

327,[OC] This weekend's top matches in Europe,"#SATURDAY

**13:30 CET/12:30 GMT: Leicester City vs Tottenham Hotspur**

This weekend we got interesting matches from all of the top 5 european leagues. It starts off in the English Premier League where Leicester meet Spurs at home. So far Leicester had a decent start in their league campaign. While it is unlikely to see them go for another championship run like a few years ago since Liverpool and Man City are just too strong, I wouldn't be surprised to see them finish above 7th or even 6th place in the end. They have a good mix of experienced players like James Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel or Jonny Evans and some promising young guns like Wilfred Ndidi, James Maddison and Youri Tielemans. Last weekend they lost their first league match this season away at Man Utd and now they face another big test at home against one of the Big 6, this time Tottenham. Spurs have as much points as Leicester (8 after 5 games) and while this doesn't seem extraordinarly high, they already drew Man City and Arsenal away from home which is nothing to sneer at. Only the 0-1 loss at home against Newcastle seemed unnecessary. This game has a draw written all over it in my opinion but let's see what will happen.

**20:45 CET/19:45 GMT: AC Milan vs Internazionale**

In Italy we got the famous *Derby di Milano* this weekend, the evergreen match for every football fanatic. While Milan had a decent start into the season with 6 points in 3 games by only scoring 2 goals themselves in true 90's style Milan fashion, Inter is so far leading the Serie A. They are the only team who managed to win all of their games. But the mood isn't the best at the moment because of the lucky draw at home against Slavia Praha in the Champions League a few days ago. In a group together with Barcelona and Dortmund this could be already the death sentence. But today this won't matter because it's derby time and while Inter are still favourites to win we all know that derbies are hard to predict.

**21:00 CET/20:00 GMT: Granada CF vs FC Barcelona**

For the LaLiga fans we also have a nice game in the evening. Barcelona didn't have the best start into the season so far. Mainly because Lionel Messi was injured for a long time and as we all know he so important for Barcelona. It's still not clear wether he will be able to start from the beginning or if he will come off from the bench in the 2nd half like against Dortmund on Tuesday but even without him, Barcelona has a top squad. So far they averaged 3 goals per game which is a good stat but on the other side their defense was quite shaky this season so far. Of course all eyes will be on the new teen prodigy Ansu Fati, who recently got his spanish citizenship. He will probably start once more from the beginning. Granada had a surprisingly good start so far, like Barcelona they have 7 points after 4 games. And while they don't have big names in their squad they looked quite competitive and like Osasuna recently, they could surprise the *Blaugrana* today.

# SUNDAY

**15:00 CET/14:00 GMT: West Ham United vs Manchester United**

**15:00 CET/14:00 GMT: Stade Rennais vs OSC Lille**

**16:45 CET/15:45 GMT: PSV Eindhoven vs Ajax Amsterdam**

**17:30 CET/16:30 GMT: Chelsea FC vs Liverpool FC**

And once again we have a top notch game in the Premier League on Sunday. This time Chelsea will face off Liverpool on Stamford Bridge. Chelsea had a mixed start in the Premier League until now and the surprising home loss in the Champions League midweek against Valencia certainly didn't help their morale but it still a surprising project to see at the moment. The reason is the transfer ban by the UEFA, therefore the *Blues* are forced to play their youngsters. But so far Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori did a great job and it will be exciting to see them play for such a big side in the upcoming months. There are doubts over many players like Kanté, Rüdiger, Hudson-Odoi, Mount etc. for this match so let's see what Frank Lampard's game plan is. Liverpool's season looks more bright so far, they cruised through the Premier League campaign like a knife through butter, winning all of their 5 games. But like Chelsea they received a blow in midweek when they lost in Napoli and therefore their first match into this young season. But no doubt motivational guru Jürgen Klopp knows how to fire up his guys and we can expect a really good game.

**18:00 CET/17:00 GMT: Eintracht Frankfurt vs Borussia Dortmund**

Frankfurt had a mixed started into the season which is no surprise when you lose players like Luka Jovic, Ante Rebic and Sebastién Haller in one transfer window. Up front the new signings André Silva and Bas Dost still need some time to blend with the team, although at least Paciencia showed some promising signs so far. But the defense, despite being basically the same like last season, showed unusual weaknesses in the past weeks. Especially important players like Makoto Hasebe and David Abraham are far from their best form. For Dortmund, things look way brighter. They were a bit unlucky only to draw Barcelona at home on Tuesday and they showed some weaknesses in their Bundesliga campaign as well, especially in their away loss at Union Berlin but other than that there are only few doubts that they will have a great league campaign. The squad is just too good. Remains to be seen how their Champions League campaign will be though, since they are unluckily in a so called *Group of Death*.

**21:00 CET/20:00 GMT: Olympique Lyonnais vs Paris Saint-Germain**

Lyon started phenomenal into the season with a 3-0 victory against Monaco and a 6-0 against the helpless Angers. But after that it went downhill, a loss at Montpellier was followed by a series of draws against Bordeaux, Amiens and Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League. This puts them under pressure today and unluckily they have to face PSG this time. For PSG the season was the opposite, they already surprisingly lost on matchday 2 against Stade Rennais. But after that they crushed every opponent so far, including an impressive 3-0 home win against Real Madrid a few days ago despite missing their top stars Neymar, Cavani and Mbappé. At least Neymar is expected to play on Sunday and maybe we will also see Cavani back in the squad. The atmosphere in the Groupama Stadium will be certainly buzzing.

**21:00 CET/20:00 GMT: Sevilla FC vs Real Madrid**

We got another top match in LaLiga on Sunday. Sevilla are leading unbeaten the table at the moment with 10 points in 4 games and are eager to put some damage on Real as well. Madrid on the other hand is in a bit of a slump and manager Zinedine Zidane is already under heavy fire in the spanish press. While they are still on a decent 3rd place in the league with 8 points after 4 matches they didn't look really convincing. To add salt to injury, they got hammered by a weakened PSG side on Wednesday. Midfield motor Luka Modric is still injured and players like Marcelo and Isco are still doubtful. But Gareth Bale, who was great so far this season, is finally back after his red card suspension against Villarreal. Also it is quite possible that we will see Eden Hazard on the pitch. He didn't look really good for *Los Blancos* but it should be only a matter of time for his breakthrough in Spain. Maybe already on Sunday?

10,Top matches from European leagues this weekend,"#SATURDAY

**15:30 CET/14:30 GMT: Bayer Leverkusen vs TSG Hoffenheim**

This is the only top match from the Bundesliga this weekend. Actually I wanted to include Mönchengladbach vs Leipzig but I fell asleep after coming home from work yesterday. For those who still don't know: Leipzig won 3-1 with a hattrick from Timo Werner and are for now leading the table. But back to Leverkusen vs Hoffenheim. Leverkusen managed to strengthen their already good squad in the summer. Two of those signings came from Hoffenheim (Amiri and Demirbay) and are now to meet their former employee. The start of the season was good for the *Werkself*, winning both games against Paderborn and Düsseldorf so far. Hoffenheim on the other lost several important players, not only the already mentioned Amiri and Demirbay, but also Joelinton (Newcastle) and Nico Schulz (Borussia Dortmund). On the other hand they bought the highly regarded Samassekou from RB Salzburg and Robert Skov from FC Copenhagen. Their start into the season was mixed (loss to Frankfurt, win against Bremen) but no one should underestimate them. Even though their star striker Kramaric is still injured. We should expect at least 4 goals here and an entertaining game.

**17:00 CET/16:00 GMT: CA Osasuna vs FC Barcelona**

Barcelona is already under pressure early into the season. They lost their opening match against Athletic Bilbao but then crushed Real Betis 5-2. Antoine Griezmann, their new top striker, managed 2 goals and 1 assist in this match and already showed why the *Blaugrana* were so eager to buy him. Griezmann will be available for this match but with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele they will miss 3 very important players today. This might be a very good opportunity for Osasuna to get something out of this game. So far they had a promising start with 4 points from their first two matches in the league. Barcelona will surely try everything here to not lose important points again like in Bilbao.

**20:45 CET/19:45 GMT: Juventus vs Napoli**

In Serie A we alredy got a clash of the two title contenders in matchday 2. Both won their opening matches into the season (Juve 1-0 vs Parma, Napoli 4-3 vs Fiorentina). Juventus was hit by terrible news yesterday. Chiellini, their star defender of the past decade, tore his ACL and will be out for a long time. Luckily they bought De Ligt from Ajax Amsterdam in the summer for a lot of money. He will most likely play Chiellini's place and have his first full match for the *Old Lady*. Napoli on the other hand will come to Turin a full squad. Milik returned after his injury last week. And maybe we will see Hirving Lozano, who came from PSV in the summer, coming off the bench somewhere in the 2nd half.

#SUNDAY

**15:00 CET/14:00 GMT: Stade Rennais vs OGC Nice**

Finally we also got a top match in the French Ligue Un today with Rennes vs Nice. Rennes had a phenomenal start into the season with 3 wins in 3 games. One of those wins was surprisingly against a flabbergasted PSG side. Unfortunately they will miss Flavien Tait due to a Red Card suspension but M'Baye Niang, their new striker from Torino, will be ready to expand his goal tally for the club from Bretagne. OGC Nice were in the news in the last days because of the takeover from British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe. With the new money they were able to buy Alexis Claude-Maurice from Lorient and Kasper Dolberg from Ajax Amsterdam. So far they a good start with 6 points out of 3 games and they will try to get at least away here with a draw.

**17:30 CET/16:30 GMT: Arsenal vs Tottenham**

Another matchday in the Premier League and another total banger of a match with the North London derby between Arsenal and Hotspurs. Arsenal started will into the season with 2 wins which was followed up with a humble defeat at Anfield against a ruthless Liverpool side. Still, with a victory today against their rivals the team can get back to the good side of their fans and their chances are quite good, despite still missing half of their defence. Tottenham is still recovering from their surprising loss at home against Newcastle. Another loss today at the North London derby and things might get ugly already. On top of that they will miss important players with Ndombele, Foyth and Walker-Peters which means we will probably see the tranfer-listed Serge Aurier at the right back position for the first time since several months. And there is still uncertainty over the future of midfielder Christian Eriksen. At least until Monday night when the summer transfer window is about to close.",football,Ubergold,0,2019-08-31

Trailing a point behind new leaders Hougang United, Bruneian side DPMM FC are looking to regain leadership as the Singapore Premier League title race reaches the business end of the 2019 season.

122,Arsenal VS Spurs,"Hey guys.  


Another weekend and another thrilling footy weekend. before I even begin to write the analysis I need to shout out to all the guys from last weeks post who had a go at Xhaxa as this review is not Xhaxa friendly.  


lets get right into shall we. First and for most guys I really think Arsenal played their best squad (In exception of Xhaxa) and the formation of 4-3-3 works best for the caliber of  players we have. two center backs always waiting to receive the ball and distribute to wing backs and a holding midfielder all looks very good. same two the Lacazette Aubamaenyang and Pepe combo up front is just to hot to handle and like many of you I am desperately waiting  for Pepe to score a goal as I feel this will open the flood gates to the quality we saw at Lille last season. I would also prefer to see Torreria in the holding Midfield roll, he has scored all his Arsenal goals playing from this position and takes a lot of pressure off the defenders.   


And as a spade is a spade, Spurs shat the bed. they could of dominated us but Arsenal intense pressure paid off and we managed to draw. I am by no means happy as both spurs goals were avoidable. Xhaxa did not win one aerial challenge and multiple times lost possession of the ball when it was coming to him in the air. his Jump that let Son through for Ericksons goal was actual school boy defending and Luiz going for the same ball was also super basics going wrong.  Xhaxas slide challenge, dear lord.... and If any one can comment that they did not see Xhaxa giving away a penalty yesterday you sir are a dam liar. every effort of his yesterday went to shit, and I was panicking when he was on the ball. I do not see him as a first team player never-mind our captain. ok Xhaxa rant over... and ultimately we played the better football and though Sokratis goal was rightfully ruled off side, we could of berried spurs with 4 goals. however this was not the case and my conclusion is that Xhaxa is basically as effective as a tree in the field.( Last dig at him I promise) Torreria and Guendozi are working Midfeilders. they keep the center tight and competitive and firm but just lack the touch to connect with our potent front 3. had we had Torreria Guendozi and Cabellos all start I feel we would have had a very different game, as when Danny came on, Tottenham hardly saw the ball besides their ineffective counter attacks. Lacazette, who I think I need to start a petition for being our Captain lead as to a phenomenal bounce back from 2-0 down which shows great squad mentality and the boys did go to try win it but tired legs won out in the end.    


But there is also great news on the Horizon, this week as Holding, Bellerin and Teirney are all back to first squad training and will hopefully feature over the weekend. (all info from Arsenal website) . i firmly believe this will service our defense better. Holding was on a great run prior his ACL and so was Bellerin and I think Tierny as the final touch adds the quality to this defense we will need. so I am really looking forward to watching all 3 of these lads play. so all in all we have a lot going for us.   


But as I have been saying the Liverpool and Spurs game were great tests to see where we are as a squad and I think we failed. We need 4 point from these two games to send a message we are a strong side, but the loss and Draw show we are still soft at the back so teams will still go all out for us. I think Emry needs to focus on winning the next 10 games. we need nothing but wins. this will get the mood right and the mentality working. the team is fit and strong and wanting to play at high intensity and we need to go out and score as many as we can per game. Lets wait and see, as it is very easy from the couch.   


But until next weekend

176,honestly the courtois hate is so unfair,"im going to get a lor of hate probbaly because of this, especially when keylor is gone but first i just want to say that im not a fan of the club, i am a barca fan but i am a keeper that watch your games as a fan of football so im 99% of the time objective and i am going to post here because i want you fans to stop on the courtois hate and im spanish but im going to talk in english because i dont know if this subreddit is in spanish or english and just came to say this so if this doesnt get attention ill translate it in spanish later.

courtois came to made his way to madrid last season for 40mill with 25 or 26 years old while navas was 31. madrid just won the 3rd CL in a row with keylor being a good keeper. first i want to say that madrid made a good signing considering keylor was old and courtois came being the best GK in the WC but for me it was disrespectful benching keylor like that, considering the great moment he had, for me courtois was better and still is but tibo had to earn it because its not like RM had a bad GK so they bought a star, no , they already had a worldclass GK maybe a bit worst but still really good and an icon for the club at this time, maybe let one of them play different competitions or something but not benching him like that, if tibo wanted to be a starter then bad for him or you wait and earn your chance or bye.

&amp;#x200B;

now for me tibo is better because i feel safer with him than with keylor but its just really unfair the hate he is getting, he has saved what he could with the  disastrous season madrid had and the poor defence, and you remember when everyone talked that its unfair for keylor because he is from latin america? well its the exact opposite now and everyone supports him and hate on tibo and are blinded keylor had terrible mistakes in important matches or you dont remember the betis game when some stupid fans who whistled him or the bayern mistake in CL semifinal or the copa del rey mistake against barca, he had a poor begining in the 2016-2017 season and the 2017-2918 season but quickly recovered and are mistakes that anyone could make like courtois and before you say i hate keylor i love him since the 2014 WC and its top 5 favourite GK because how sometimes irregular he is like me and the styke of goalkeeping to all out reflexes and showstopper and the way he is that i wanted to him be starter in the 2014-2015 season because how bad casillas was in that season so yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

now im going to answer some of the frequent questions they use to attack courtois

&amp;#x200B;

**madrid had the same defence like courtois has now and received less goals**yes they are the same but their form was better at the time and had cristiano which saved the team in multiple occasions like the betis game in the 2016-2017 seasons were CR7 and ramos made a goal to win 2-1 with a mistake from keylor

**keylor made madrid win 3 champions leagues**

it was cristiano and some ref decisions tbh but cristiano in particular and some good keylor and ramos matches

**when the team was playing bad he saved the team**

yeah he sometimes did but sometimes not which is not his fault but for exmaple Madrid vs Spurs 1-3, barca games in general, and more not to mention some CL mistakes that almost cost the team like the mistake against juve 2 seasons ago, and courtois came in the worst madrid ever and save them a couple of times with only one year against 5 years of keylor in madrid

**more clean sheets**

better madrid at the time, more time playing for madrid, etc

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i may have leaved some points behind but i just want to post this the quickest i can so you see and wrote this what camed to my head so discuss with respect in comments and let this be a good debate with respect

“พวกคุณได้เห็นฟอร์มของพวกเขาที่ เบิร์นลี่ย์ กันแล้ว จริงอยู่ว่าในช่วง 20 นาทีแรกพวกเขาเล่นได้ไม่ดีเท่าไหร่ แต่พวกเขาก็ยังเดินหน้าต่อไป และทำประตูแรกได้ ก่อนจะมาได้ลูกที่สอง พวกเขามีความเด็ดขาด พวกเขาเล่นเกมรับได้ดี เกมรุกก็เล่นได้ดี แถมแผงกลางของเขาก็ดูแข็งแกร่งและมีประสบการณ์สูง ตอนนี้พวกเขาดูมีสภาพเป็นทีมระดับที่จะเป็นแชมป์ลีกได้ ซึ่งที่จริงฤดูกาลก่อนพวกเขาก็เล่นในระดับแบบนี้ได้เหมือนกัน”

This is a bit of unusual one, but ill keep it brief. Basically ever since Ive been growing up I always played (or tried to play football). Unfortunately for me the basics just wouldnt come to me, almost a decade later I still cant do more then 3 kick ups in a row, cant dribble the ball (my body movement is very stiff and choppy aswell) poor ball control, struggle to pass under pressur eetcc etc. 


Ive always tried ro get better but it just seems more coordination is so out of sync and choppy. Im basically in my early 20s now and get invited to play a game or two against good people, but I know my ability is very very poor. 


Do you guys think I should just forget trying to play soccer/football or does anyone have any tips on how I can basically try learn everything again?",football,mountainr1,10,2019-09-05

มาราโดน่า มีปัญหาด้านเข่าจนกระทั่งทำให้เขาจำเป็นต้องลาออกจากการควบคุม โดราโดส [youlikebet เครดิตฟรี](https://youlikemember.com/r/register/35) สมาคมในลีกระดับ 2 ของเม็กซิโกไปเมื่อช่วมิ.ย.ก่อนหน้าที่ผ่านมา แม้กระนั้นเจ้าตัวก็รับการดูแลรักษาจนถึงมีลักษณะอาการดียิ่งขึ้นแล้ว โดยก่อนหน้าที่ผ่านมาเขาก็สามารถเดินไปไหนมาไหนในโรงหมอได้สบายขึ้น

369,Mourinho's next job,"More than a year ago, I made a post called [**""The Decline of Mou""**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Calcio/comments/86rnpt/the_decline_of_mou/), which looked back at his career and charted out where he lost his touch. While it's largely come true, and he's now out in the cold, in terms of top level coaching opportunities, I don't think he's done yet. I think he's doing the smart thing by waiting for the right job. The bit about him being emotional, not liking being jobless in the off season is touching, but it's better than to take up some Chinese, Portugese, Middle Eastern, South American or even International coaching gig. That'll *really* kill his career. 

When we analyse his options, we need to analyse his roots. When he first took up a major coaching gig, it was with Porto. They're not the biggest club in Portugal, and were considered the overwhelming long shots for a Champions League title. He won it with them. Then he went to Chelsea in the Premiership, at a time when the league was a duopoly between Wenger's Arsenal and Ferguson's Manchester United. He broke that up. Then he went to Inter, and won their first Champions League in 40 years. Beat the Champions of Russia (Rubin Kazan), Spain (Barcelona), England (Chelsea) and Germany (Bayern Munich) on their way to a treble. 

After that, he moved to Real Madrid. That's the move where he was no longer the rebel, fighting the juggernaut with the 'resistance'. He was now part of the ""Empire"". He was expected to win, and win in style. It's when things fell apart for him. His coaching ability, both tactical and motivational, meant he'd win, but he no longer had the fans behind him, and his players no longer wanted to fight, wither with him or for him. Judging by all this, I think a job at a smaller club that still has history, &amp; fights for honours is the best possible option for him at this point. 

I think Dortmund in Germany might be his ideal choice. He has young players full of talent, a stable financial situation, and gets to take on the Evil Empire that is Bayern. Valencia in Spain is another such candidate. He fights for the 4th place initially, and if Lim is will to not meddle and back him, there's potential there. A team I'd love to see him at is Everton. They're developing a serious, long-term project. Start off with getting qualification to the Champions League, then see if there's more to be had. A lot of good young players, and an ambitious owner who's willing to spend. I can even see him joining Tottenham, if Poch leaves, that is. He'd give them that self-belief they covet, and his name would convince guys like Kane and others to stick around. In Italy, Roma might be a good option. Lots of talented young players, and his personality might force the owner to stop remote controlling the club from Boston and give his the keys. I'm sceptical about all of this though, especially the last option.

Funnily enough, I doubt he does any of this. I think if he waits it out, Real might sack Zidane ([who I never rated](https://old.reddit.com/r/Calcio/comments/7j33hq/sassuolo_milan_inters_situation_shows_the/)), and ask him back, especially now when the old guard is out or old, and he gets complete authority. If no Real, I can see him being tempted by PSG, who'd ask him to win the Champions League, and back him in the market. Even Bayern might be interested if Kovac doesn't deliver. Whether these would be the sensible choices is up for debate. I do, however, think that there's one more run left him Mourinho yet. And this time, whichever club takes him might get a much more subdued &amp; calm Mou, one who's willing to stay long term. He just needs to choose the right project carefully.",football,vik1980,7,2019-09-07

23,Today starts the new Bundesliga season with the match between Bayern München and Hertha BSC,"**Match Start:** 20:30 CET

**Is it on Free TV?:** Yes. As usual, the first match of the Bundesliga season is availabe on Free-TV. You can watch it on ZDF via TV or Internet. If you aren't living in Germany, try a VPN for the Internet livestream.

**Match Preview:**

As usual, **Bayern München** is the favourite for the Bundesliga title but Hertha BSC should not be underestimated. In the last 5 league games between these teams there were three draws and one win for each club. Bayern heavily invested in their defense this summer with the signings of Benjamin Pavard (35 mio. €, VfB Stuttgart) and Lucas Hernández (80 mio. €, Atlético Madrid). Since the attempts to get Leroy Sané from Manchester City were futile, they recently also loaned Ivan Perišić from Inter Milan.

**Hertha BSC** on the other hand got a huge investment from the wealthy German businessman Lars Windhorst this summer. A portion of this money was spent on the promising talent Dodi Lukebakio (20 mio. €, Watford FC). While Lukebakio didn't have a great time at Watford, he excelled at his loan spell last season with Fortuna Düsseldorf, scoring 14 goals and 5 assists in 34 league and national cup games. They also bought Germany U21 NT player Eduard Löwen (7 mio. €, 1.FC Nürnberg). Last but not least Marko Grujić from Liverpool FC extended his loan for another season in Berlin who proved to be an important player for the Hertha.

So, I hope some of you guys will tune in and enjoy the show later.",football,Ubergold,2,2019-08-16

43,"Hypothetical Rule: If an attacking player is brought down in the box in the act of shooting, and in doing so scores a goal, the original goal should stand with a subsequent penalty to be taken after the fact potentially giving the attacking team two goals from one play...","Here's the scenario: An attacking player is making a run into the box, they shoot and hit the ball cleanly, but whilst doing so they're brought down by a defending players challenge, the ball rolls/sails past the goalkeeper into the back of the net.

Under the current rules the goal would be awarded with no subsequent penalty UNLESS the referee had awarded the penalty before the goal had been scored, in that case, the original goal would be disallowed putting all of the pressure on the penalty taker to convert.

Under this new hypothetical rule the goal would be allowed BUT the penalty would also be given allowing the attacking team to potentially score two goals from the one play.

This rule change would be massively beneficial for teams that are 1 or even 2 goals down and would potentially breath life into those fixtures that are dead and buried after a team has gone 2 or 3 goals up.

There are of course downsides to this hypothetical rule, one that immediately comes to mind is that it could encourage teams that have a 2+ goal deficit to play for penalties and in a roundabout way potentially encourage diving, but the use of technology including VAR potentially negate this, another is that it would effectively negate the advantage of having a two goal lead, but I feel like this would encourage teams to always press for a third fully knowing that the opposition could equalise at any moment.

What do we all think of this hypothetical rule?

Disagreeing but keeping my mouth shut, during a break, I talked to a friend and told him about how I thought our coaches idea  possession without final product was just dumb, to win games you have to shoot, not play around and posses,he disagreed and said without possession you can’t shoot.

357,Preview: Top matches from the European leagues this weekend,"#SATURDAY

**18:30 CET/17:30 GMT: Liverpool vs Arsenal**

We will start off with the top match in the Premier League. Both Liverpool and Arsenal are the only teams in England who have won both matches so far and therefore sitting in 1st/2nd place in the league. While Alisson is still injured for Liverpool, Arsenal is missing half of their defense with Tierney, Mavropanos and Bellerin. So far Arsenal had a good start but playing at Anfield is a huge task. Liverpool is undefeated at home in Premier League since 39 (!) matches.

**18:30 CET/17:30 GMT: Schalke vs Bayern München**

This is the Bundesliga top match for today. Schalke is the third biggest club in Germany by revenue and they got a decent squad but last season was horrible for them. It was so bad, that they actually nearly got relegated. Now David Wagner, the Saint of Huddersfield, is their new manager and they are looking to forget the last 12 months. In their first match they got a respectable away draw at Mönchengladbach but now they will face an even bigger task with Bundesliga behemoth Bayern München. Bayern only played 2-2 in their home match against Hertha BSC to the surprise of many people but they were quite active in the transfer market the last few days with the addition of Coutinho from FC Barcelona and the nearly done acquisition of Marc Roca from Espanyol who is supposed to replace the underperforming Renato Sanches. 

**20:00 CET/19:00 GMT: Benfica vs FC Porto**

Already in the third matchday in Primeira Liga we got *O Clássico*, the famous derby between Benfica and Porto. While Benfica had a very good start into the season by beating Pacos de Ferreira and Belenenses with ease 5-0 and 2-0. Meanwhile Porto are in panic mode already. Not only did they surprisingly lose their season opening match against Gil Vicente but they also got crushed at home by Russian side FK Krasnodar in the Champions League qualifiers which means they will miss out on a lot of money this year. A Champions League without Porto is really unusual for the football watcher since they participated 24 (!) times there already. And now they have to face a very strong Benfica. If they lose here we can expect to hear *Fado* music in many places of Northern Portugal.

#SUNDAY

**15:00 CET/14:00 GMT: Bournemouth vs Manchester City**

On Sunday we got another interesting matchup in the Premier League between Bournemouth and Manchester City. Both clubs got 4 points so far and therefore are still unbeaten but the goals are different of course. City will try everything to win here to stay in sight of Liverpool. They were really unlucky with their home draw against Hotspurs, despite 30-3 goal shots the end result was a mere 2-2. Bournemouth on the other hand had a great start into season despite the low budget compared to the big guns of the league and despite the many injuries. While City will most likely only miss three players with Sané, Stones and Mendy, Bournemouth's lazaret include seven players. Can they hold up or will City go on rampage mode? We will find out very soon.

**15:30 CET/14:30 GMT: RB Leipzig vs Eintracht Frankfurt**

It's the 2nd league match for the highly regarded manager Julian Nagelsmann with Leipzig. The start of the season was quite impressive with a 4-0 away win over Union Berlin. If they keep up this form it will be really hard for Eintracht to get away with something here. Frankfurt also won their opening match against Hoffenheim. But the good mood was lowered by the recent 0-1 away loss against RC Strasbourg in the 1st leg of the final round in EL qualifiers. To add insult to injury, Eintracht top player Ante Rebic threw a fit at half time against Strasbourg, telling manager Adolf Hütter to not play him anymore in the 2nd half. Which means that he probably will leave the club, the most likely destination is to be rumoured Inter Milan. After already losing Jovic and Haller in the summer, this would be another huge blow for the club.",football,Ubergold,2,2019-08-24

-

---

-

######**Juve**

The slow-burn in their outgoing market has fucked many teams. After wrapping up Ramsey early, then securing Demiral and Romero later in the year, they danced with De Ligt for many months before securing him. Since then, while they've gotten Rabiot, they've not been able to place anyone from the likes of Mandzukic, Rugani, Dybala, Cuadrado, Matuidi, Higuain, Can &amp; Bentancur. Because of this, they've not collected the bounty needed to take Icardi from Inter, or Lukaku from Manchester United, or Neymar from PSG, or Rakitic from Barcelona, or...so on and so forth. The lack of sales has limited their activity, and still weighs on their wage budget.

Even the sale business they've conducted has been questionable. Cancelo for Danilo just to make some profit, and selling Kean for that same reason has confounded. It means they're either visionaries who sold these players at high value, or the Ronaldo transfer has put a strain on their budget they never imagined. 

Juve enter the season looking the most vulnerable they've looked in the last many years. Sarri is known for slow starts while his teams download his playing philosophy and implement them. With Napoli and Inter reloading in big ways, the optimists will say that this season represents the biggest chance to unseat them form the top. The pessimists, meanwhile, will sit and lean back, secure in the knowledge that they've just shored up their defense and midfield for the next 6-10 years.

-

---

-

######**Milan**

How Milan will be judged will come down solely on Giampaolo's performance. The Board brought Maldini into the fold, the first time since he retired, and turned the sporting decisions over to him. He's decided to start with the coach, and then empower him, back him to the hilt. His choice, Maco Giampaolo, will have the pieces needed to play the way he wants to. They've gotten unfashioned names like Bennacer, Krunic, Leao and Duarte; players without big names, ones that might not excite the causal fans but young, and with tons of upside. All because Giampaolo wanted very specific players for his system. 

That's really the crux of the matter. They've given him the players he needed, wanted, and now it's all in his hands. If he gets them playing attractive football and developing the young but talented players now at his disposal, like he did with his Sampdoria side, it'll be considered a success. Even without Champions League qualification, the stress should be on player development and play style first, and results second. The key is to make sure he's given time and patience. Establishing a system, an 'identity' for a team can take time, especially when he's trying to implement a possession and attacking based team. If the fans start clamouring for results instantly, and putting too much pressure on him, there's a big probability that it'll end up like Gasperini at Inter. As long as they're in with a chance to qualify for Europe, the Milan fans &amp; Board should take the results and stick with Giampaolo.

######**Roma**

For me Roma's transfer window is a mixed bag. Hard to believe people going gaga over offering Dzeko that renewal. I think it's bordering on foolishness. Petrachi will regret not taking the 15m from Inter, and he'll prove a burden on their books this time next season. I'm not convinced on Diawara either, for the simple reason that he sat on Napoli's bench for two seasons, convinced neither Sarri nor Ancelotti. Let's see how those two play out. I could be wrong. Won't be the first time.

I'm on the fence on Lopez and Mancini, simply for never having seen Lopez, and having seen how Atalanta players seem to struggle outside of Gasperini's system. Same logic applies to Spinazzola, and he's a right footed player who plays on the opposite wing. He isn't even a winger, but a wingback, who'll now have to operate as a fullback. Let's see how he copes. If there's one thing helping him, his quickness will be his weapon under Fonseca. 

I think Mustafi on a loan is a far better option than Rugani. From getting swindled by Juve for their bench player, Petrachi went to securing a massive steal for Mustafi. His quickness and competence on the ball will suit Fonseca's system a lot more. A loan with option to buy provides a safety net. And he won't have to wait to be acclimatised in Serie A either. And I think Veretout will prove a big success. He's their best buy so far.

It'll all come down to how well Fonseca transmits his ideas to his team. He's new in Serie A, and is getting a brand new midfield and defense. It'll take time. Roma management and fans are not known for patience. 

-

-

######**Napoli**

At one point, their window promised so much. They'd secured Manolas, plugging the hole next to Koulibaly, and then had an active interest in Pepe, James and Icardi. Get those three and I could serious see them challenging for Serie A. Insigne, Pepe &amp; Icardi, what an attacking trident that would've been. Personally, I think Pepe will be a massive loss. I've seen him in France, and he's the kind of talent that can change games by himself. And to nearly get him for 50+m and Ounas would've been considered a steal. Sadly, ADL's lowballing tendencies caught up with him. Lozano is a nice player, but he's considered a back-up/ depth to Callejon. Getting Pepe for the right wing would've been like getting Manolas for central defence, a game changer.

Funnily enough, it's still an extremely strong team. They've not lost any major players, plugged their defense, and brought in some nice depth players. I think replacing Rog with Elmas for practically the same price is extremely smart business. They're not clear cut title favourites like Juve, but in the vicinity. It'll take something special to get there. And ADL is trying hard to make amends for the Pepe disappointment and chasing that 'something special' eagerly. Icardi is the kind of player that'll put them over the top. Napoli's brand of football is perfect for his style of play, and if they manage to bring him aboard, Pepe will be forgotten, and Ancelotti will have the diamond needed up top to cut this Juve machine.

######**Fiorentina**

A lot of questions in Florence. They've got a new owner, an unhappy star, and a manager who's under pressure even before the season's begun. After Pioli's resignation, Montella made a mistake by not waiting for a fresh season &amp; taking over immediately. What followed was a brutal downturn of results, nearly pulling them in the relegation battle. The pre-season hasn't been better, and they've struggled against rank opposition. Now Chiesa has his heart set on a move to historic rivals Juve, many fans won't mind seeing Montella gone already, and Commiso is having to take over the club in murky conditions. 

Things aren't all doom &amp; gloom though. They've got a promising set of young players to build on. I like Sottil. I think he'll help in trying to make the fans forget Chiesa. Milenkovic looks like a rock to build on. And while selling Veretout will hurt, Pulgar looks a great replacement. He's less physical than the frenchman, but more adept at playing between he lines, both on the defensively and offensively. I think he adds some direction to their game. If Vlahovic continues to develop, and Dragowski replicates last seasons heroics, they'll have a nice young core going for the future.

I think they'll manage just but a high mid table finish, but that's probably just me letting my doubts about Montella's ability as a manager cloud my judgement. In any case, a new owner promising to invest, great young players for the future, for me they're certainly on a much better footing that Lazio.

######**Inter**

Probably the team with the biggest changes this season. After bringing Marotta early last season, rumours say they took Conte well before the season ended, and have since been on a path to completely change the DNA of their team. If Conte is known for ""You can't eat in a $100 restaurant with $10 in your pocket"", then his quote ""Players win games, Squads win titles"" should tell you what to expect from this new Inter. No more Pazza Inter. 

Conte's hire means a change of philosophy. Neither he nor Marotta tolerate dissidents or trouble makers. This means they plan on freezing Icardi, and have shipped out Nainggolan. And with Lukaku, Sensi, Barella, Lazaro and Godin, taken a great mix of champions; young, hungry talents and proven players. Rumour has it that they're now trying seriously for Sergej Milinkovic-Savic from Lazio. They also have young talents to match any other club in the world. Bastoni, Agoume, Esposito, Pirola, and options for the likes of Zinho, Pinamonti and Karamoh means their future is bright.

Their owners, Suning, privately owned, is considered the third biggest company in China, behind Huawei and one other. They also own a Chinese club, and working hard behind the scenes, like new Head Quarters, redeveloping the training centre, and investing heavily in all areas of the club. Simply put, the ownership is serious, and firmly behind the club. They backed the coach when Icardi dragging his feet meant doubts over Lukaku's transfer. They've held firm in front of Icardi's desire for Juve and only Juve, even if it means a loss of 50m from Icardi's benching. They're taking both a short and a long term view here, and have the pockets to do it. Their end objective being, break this Juve machine completely. It seems it's well possible.

**Lazio**

Another year, another directionless transfer campaign for Lazio. It seems like they just pick out the best value players available, and then hope something special comes out, like Champions League football, or a Coppa Italia title, or a break-out of a young player. As long as Inzaghi doesn't ruffle feathers, and start asking for expensive players or demanding more control, he'll stay, even if he's pretty much plateaued there. He's competent, but that's it. Lazio Board seem happy with a consistent upper mid-table showing.

-

**Atalanta**

I'm not convinced about their ability yet. They played fantastic last season, but this coming season is different. They'll have much of the same squad as last season, but the added pressure of playing in the Champions League. Both Papu Gomez and Ilicic are now 31, and played 30+ games last season. Will they be able to handle a similar long season along plus Champions League games? How Gaperini pilots them will show just how good a manager he really is. I doubt they'll finish Top 4 again.

-

**Sampdoria**

I've always rated EdF highly, and I'll back him at Sampdoria. How they perform will tell how correct I am. They've sold some nice players like Andersen and Praet, and are facing a change of ownership too. Vialli and his consortium seem close to securing the club from Ferrero. I doubt it'll affect their window now, but in January or next season is a different matter. When they show EdF patience or want a guy of their own is a big question. All in all, another season of player development and decent to good football awaits. I think.

-

**Torino**

The issue with Torino is the same as with their manager Mazzari. They look good against the weaker teams, but as soon there's a step up in competition, they stumble. Or they look organised against the top teams, but drop points against beatable opponents. There's no consistency and they offer no confidence. It's the same with their payers too. Belotti, Zaza &amp; co. can amaze in one game, but struggle in the next. They managed a Europe League finish last season purely by luck, and I doubt they'll manage that this season.

######**Random Observations**

Conte's Inter packs the middle but leaves the wings open. I think any team that plays with the 3-4-3 or the 4-4-2 (Napoli and Atalanta), and double up on the wings might trouble Inter, seeing as they only play the one man on the wings. The Milan Derby will/ should be an exciting match. Giampaolo's 4-3-1-2 means he packs his midfield too, even more so than Inter. 

Sarri's 4-3-3, once it takes roots, should be super fun. He has better players at his disposal than ever before. And a depth of squad he's not known before either. It's also the first time he'll go up against Conte. The last time Conte was in Italy, the term 'Sarriball' had not yet been invented. 

I think there'll be a lot more tactical football on display (even more so than usual), seeing as how EdF, Conte, Giampaolo, Sarri, Mazzarri and Gasperini are all coaches that are tactically very capable. All of those head to head encounters will be tough. And fun.",football,vik1980,1,2019-08-25

I have a problem though, and that is that nearly every football boot/shoe I try is simply too tight on me, I understand that it has to be that way, but pain builds up over time and they become unusable. Mostly, the issue occurs on the front of the foot, the toes basically. Due to tight fitting shoes in the past, I had to have surgery for ingrown toenails, and so that doesn’t happen again, I can’t have anything too tight on my toes. 


I really wonder sometimes if there is a shoe out there that can suit my needs, I would really like your input on the matter and if you have any shoe recommendations.

Pep Guardiola has confirmed forward Leroy Sane could be out for “six or seven months” with an ACL injury.

The club confirmed on Thursday that Sane was due to have surgery for the injury suffered in City’s Community Shield win over Liverpool at Wembley Stadium last Sunday.

On Friday, Guardiola expanded on the extent of the damage, saying: “I’m not a doctor or physio but normally this kind of injury, ACL, is six/seven months.

394,"New rule: the ""courtesy penalty""","I think the thing i love most about football is its ability to bring together an entire community week in-week out and its this community that really continues to drive my passion for football each year.

I really don't think that the community aspects of football are celebrated enough and i might have come up with an incontroversial yet effective way for teams to pay tribute to their biggest community members out on the pitch.

&amp;#x200B;

by invoking the ""courtesy penalty"",

to invoke this rule a team must be leading by 3 goals or more in their home stadium at the time of a further penalty being awarded to them. Example: Liverpool vs Arsenal (5-1) \[Saturday 29th July 2018\], Liverpool lead Arsenal in the 64th minute 4-1 when they are  awarded a penalty as Dejan Lovren is downed in the penalty box, they are already leading by 3 goals so they are in a highly advantageous position prior to the referee's decision to award a penalty to Liverpool, the game is surely finished at this point.

Robert Firminho steps up to the plate and makes it 5 for his club second later.

Although by rule of the courtesy penalty Liverpool would've had a second option in this scenario as they could also decide to award the penalty to an established member in the teams community who is deserving of the recognition and has been predetermined before the game. This would be a rolling position that is awarded as a sort of honour/tribute to that person.

Example of who i mean by this.

Local officials,

Youth referees,

Long-Time fans,

People of notoriety,

Community/Service Workers.

Anyone really with no affiliation to the clubs roster/cheque book who would otherwise never get this opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Ofcourse i am aware rule would likely not have been invoked in this case due to the magnitude of the game and the amount of time left on the clock, which is fine, but i'm sure you get the picture at this point.

I'm really not too fussed how this idea is treated, but i think it is definetly worth putting on here for discussion.",football,lemonmamgo,5,2019-08-10

***Madrid have offered a choice of several prominent members of their senior squad, including their own disillusioned forward, Gareth Bale.***

I understand that the 0-0 result was disappointing for many fans, but there's a backstory behind this game. Brazil's offense was heavily marked by Italy's perenially brilliant defense led by Baresi (who played injured, by the way). Meanwhile, Italy's offense -- particularly Baggio -- played injured as well, thus not being in top form to score goals against the rather inferior Brazilian defense, although in my opinion Taffarel was a better keeper than Pagliuca, which balanced things out.

At the end of the day, all Italy did was to prolong the inevitable loss with great defense, as the injuries and immense heat in California would  play a factor in their missed penalties, granting Brazil their fourth title in the World Derby.",football,PresClintDempsey,1,2019-07-17

He is currently preparing for his sophomore year. He is in cross country right now but out of all the runners he 5’8 140 pounds so he’s build like a football player, he has everything in order. He’s extremely buff and when I taught him in Physical Education last year he was crazy in sports always trying to make every play in any sport. When we had flag football as our unit omg it was amazing. I know he has a huge passion for football and he has crazy good hands and catches everything. He even played the seniors in body con during a free day and was using his size to his advantage and caught so much. Even a hail marry for the win. He has good grades and is confident, he’s the stereotypical sports player. He is one of the best runners in XC and would be a great WR in football. He also is agressive and in pe it was a problem because he would hit and chance he got ( one time in basketball he trucked a guy flying to prevent a score and the guy was twice his size) I know of his troubled past about his father and siblings on drugs and people targeting him to beat him up but he’s an outlier. He doesn’t do drugs or shady things and he has strived to help people around him and is very friendly and happy. But in sports everyday before a run he is pissed and wants to run and will joke around with teammates all around he lifts the team and gives it his all. He recently ran on a calf tear.

198,VAR System that Works,"Hi there, I have thought of a VAR system that deals with the criticism that the current system has attracted, and it works as follows:

- Once per half, a team captain can challenge a call made by officials.
- If the captain is right, the decision is overturned and they retain the challenge and can use another that half, if they're wrong, they lose the challenge for the half.
- During this challenge, the clock stops, and resumes upon the official decision after referring to VAR.
- During ET, one additional challenge is given to each team.

Upon the implementation of this, the following is achieved:

- Games aren't held up for minutes on end repeatedly due to marginal calls being checked (despite VAR allegedly being for clear and obvious errors).
- Due to the clock stopping, it cannot be used for time-wasting purposes.
- The role of Team Captain gets more significance and responsibility. They can be advised by teammates, but they make the final call.
- If a call is incorrectly challenged, a clear mistake later on cannot be challenged because the captain jumped the gun - rendering VAR something desired for larger and clearer mistakes.
- Fans will blame officials screwing their team less because their team have full control of the situation, and could theoretically (though unlikely) successfully overturn multiple calls.

It is a bit like the Tennis replay system that has worked remarkably well. At the start, calls can be challenged, but that right is lost upon there being incorrect challenges.",football,GramAM,2,2019-07-21

293,Disillusioned football fan of 25 years considering changing the club I support,"TLDR: Bolton Wanderers supporter for 25 years, disillusioned with the club, fan base, ownership, players, matchday experience and is considering supporting another non-rival football club. Possibly obtaining a season ticket. Is this acceptable or should I stand by my club?

\-----------------

So, I'm a Bolton Wanderers supporter of 25 years now. Had a season ticket for about 10 of those years and go to as many local away games as possible. Matchday for me is a family event with my dad, brother, grandparents, and maybe friends enjoying the game together and catching up after a tough week at work. I was also part of the founding members of the Bolton Wanderers Supporters Trust and own pretty much all signed framed shirts of BWFC legends.

As you may know, Bolton are now in admin, have a 12 point deduction for the next season in League One, have literally 1 registered player since the 3 others are leaving, still don't have a preferred bidder for new ownership and still owe creditors about £12m. 

We're now 10 days away from the new season with no kits announced, or even season ticket pricing announced. Nevermind season ticket produced and delivered.

But my love for the club have wavered for a while now. We've had problems for a long while now that's been well documented in the news. We've had con men on the board for a long time with self-satisfying personal interests only. The fan base are unbelievably negative and often argue with one another in the stands. It's toxic from the board, to the players, to the media, to the fans. We used to be a 'family club', but a glimpse at our social media channels and you will see next to no fan involvement. 

Our potential new owners are either Laurence Bassini, who is most famous for only doing interviews in a hardhat whilst running Watford FC into the ground (then became backrupt twice), or a consortium called Football Ventures who have been the preferred bidder for almost a month now without completing the transaction. We still have no idea what their plans for the club are.

Football is my main hobby, but when your club is in this much turmoil, it makes you lose interest in football as a whole and that's sickening for me. Therefore, I'm considering supporting another club. Which feels like utter betrayal, but Bolton are causing such a negative impact on my life I'm seriously considering it. Because as it stands, I might not even have a Bolton Wanderers football club to support next season!

I know people change houses, cars, wives, etc, but football clubs are not often one. I know people say that they 'stand by their club through thick and thin', which I have, but I can't continue to attend games that I don't look forward to, endure a game of 'hoof ball' for 90 minutes whilst your own fans boo your own players and have a general negative ethos of how to play football. So it's either a choice of taking a break from football and seeing how Bolton progress with the takeover and see whether it changes the atmosphere of the club, or attend a few games of another club and see how I feel about it.

Is that acceptable? Or should I stand by my club?

I'm not after a club that's winning trophies each year. I just want a club that doesn't have constant bad news pouring out of it whilst you're away from the ground, or a toxic atmosphere whilst you're in the stands. I want to feel part of my club again and have a connection with the players. Players that want to be there and fight for the shirt. I want to see their training sessions, the ethos, the theory behind player recruitment and tactics as I find that as interesting as watching a game on matchday. I would probably be attending their games on my own, without my family, or with my girlfriend.

My friends, I had some inspiration so I have drafted a new competition format below. It can be used when countries decide to consolidate their National Leagues into 1 bigger league, which I think is unavoidable at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

***Super Liga (30 teams)***

&amp;#x200B;

***Warm Up Sessions (Aug-Sep)***

* *6 groups of 5 teams playing home and away (8 games)  (Aug-Sep)*
* *Each group has 2 seeded teams and 3 unseeded teams*

&amp;#x200B;

***Winter Sessions (Oct-Dec)***

* *5 groups of 6 teams playing home and away (10 games)  (Oct-Dec)*
* *Each group will be formed based on number of points from Warm Up Sessions* 	  
 *(to create groups equal in strength)*  
* *Numbers 1-4 of each group qualify for Play-Off Sessions*
* *Numbers 5-6 of each group qualify for Relegation Sessions*  
 

***Winter Break***

&amp;#x200B;

***Play-Off Sessions***  ***(Jan-Apr)***

* *2 groups of 10 teams playing home and away (18 games)* 
* *Each group will be formed based on number of points from earlier 18 matches*   
 *(to create groups equal in strength)*  
* *Points of earlier 18 games will be carried over into Play-off Sessions.*
* *12 teams with highest number of points after 36 matches will be seeded for next season*  
 

***Relegation Sessions (Jan-Apr)***

* *1 group of 10 teams playing home and away (18 matches) (Jan-Apr)*
* *No 1-4 stay earn position in Super Liga for next year*
* *No 5-6 will  play promotion/relegation play-off matches to stay in Super Liga*
* *No 7-10 will relegate from Super Liga*

&amp;#x200B;

***Final (May)***

* *Group Winners from Play-Off Sessions plays best of 3 final match for championship* 
* *Team with highest number of points goes into final with slight advantage, it plays 1st and 3rd match at home ground*

50,Why does Messi need a world cup to be considered the greatest ?,"Ok so hear me out first , I don't see a problem with people not considering Messi the greatest , that's a reasonable opinion and many people do not consider him the greatest, I say reasonable opinion because you can't say for example that pogba is the greatest of all time , that's just a dumb opinion. 

If you think Messi is not the greatest , it's not an unreasonable opinion , because you could argue other players were the greatest and that's fine. However , what doesn't make sense me to is when people say Messi isn't the greatest because he hasn't won a world cup. This arguement simply lacks logic and I don't understand how this arguement is so widely accepted because it simply lacks logic.  

Let's say if Messi won the world cup final in 2014 , and let's say Messi had little impact on that game , then you would consider Messi the greatest ? Even though he didn't do anything extra than he had already done in his career in that match , just because of that match you will now consider him the Goat? How do people take this arguement seriously , I have seen so many so called football experts repeat this. 

If you would say that Messi is a ""system player"" , and can't perform for Argentina like he can for Barcelona, then that makes sense. That arguement has logic  And, it's  true , he doesn't perform as well for Argentina as he has done with Barca , although Messis best performances with Barca are an incredibly high standard to compare ANYONE with , even Messi himself . IMO, the level of  football Messi played while in guardiolas era is unmatched by anyone in history . And Barcelona now are not as good as they were in 2008-2012,he no longer has that platform that he once had , he has to do most of the midfield work himself  yet he still manages to keep an incredibly high level of football . 

Now back to my original point , the arguement that Messi NEEDS a world cup to be considered the goat comes from people with either a low IQ OR are emotional, because it is simply not an intelligent objective arguement .",football,edyshady96,13,2019-07-02

179,How good is Women’s football?,"Tried posting this on r/soccer and all I got was people telling me it’s crap, so I’m hoping for more of a discussion here on different aspects of the game. 

I’m not looking to agitate anyone, I want a genuine discussion of the good and bad aspects of the game. Please include the overall quality of the tournament and the quality of the best teams. 

I have watched most of the semi finals and bits and bobs throughout, so judge my thoughts as you will. 

Firstly, I think there is some top level technical quality there, for example in the US and Japanese teams. We see lots of nice dribbles and passing moves from certain teams. However, I have noticed that a lot of the defenders are terrible on the ball. No ball playing centre backs here, they just hoof it all the time. 

Some of the poorer teams have atrocious keepers, but the quality of the best keepers is excellent in terms of shot stopping. Not much to be said for claiming crosses; it’s either not done or done poorly. 

Even the best teams suffer from making a lot of simple mistakes, like easy misplaced passes or messing up a simple touch, and I think this stems from my biggest issue. 

Tactical cohesion and defensive organisation are poor. We see a lot of untracked runs and poor marking from defences across the tournament. This leads to a number of teams playing almost solely through crosses from deeper positions, relying on poor defending to score, or a lot of reliance on set plays. A number of teams (England stood out for me in their semi final) don’t seem to have an attacking plan: they just hoof it long and then work from there. This falls at the feet of the coaches in my opinion. 

Two changes to the Women’s game I’ve seen suggested are smaller goals and smaller pitches. I think smaller goals are unnecessary as there is evidence that the best keepers are perfectly capable of keeping ‘man-sized’ goals, suggesting improved uptake and coaching will lead to more and better quality keepers. 

Smaller pitches are intriguing. I don’t think fitness is an issue, but I have noticed instances where teams struggle to make up the ground in a counter attack, and I think this also leads to a lot of hoofing. A lot of defences (not just park the bus teams) sit very deep, and I think this is to counteract the hoof ball or ball over the top tactics a lot of teams employ. Defences struggle to push out in general. I’m not sure smaller pitches would encourage teams to push out and play higher lines, but it might make counter attacks a more viable option. I’m not really sure about this, and it would of course cause logistical issues for grass roots level training and facilities, so maybe just better, more adventurous coaching is required.",football,HayekReincarnate,15,2019-07-04

201,This is something I wrote during the Wayne Rooney controversy but I wasn't on Reddit at the time: Let Rooney have his swansong – England caps have very little value anyway.,"Wayne Rooney will finally say farewell to the England national team when they face the USA in a friendly. Yet instead of focussing on giving the best possible send-off to one of the nation’s all-time greats, there has been an enormous hoohah about how the match, in which Rooney will neither start nor officially captain the side, will devalue the England cap, previously a great honour reserved only for the country’s elite players. As if it had any value in the first place. This is a nonsensical view for several reasons.

Firstly, this is a friendly, long the bane of the average club-loving footy fan, which Rooney will supposedly hijack for his moment of glory. If this were a UEFA Nations League fixture, wherein there lies at least a vague semblance of an attempt to assign importance to what is effectively still a friendly, I would have more truck with the idea that the fixture is somehow devalued. However, this is not the case. The international friendly is truly the bottom of the barrel of top-level football, a swirling blackhole of injuries, boredom and over-excitement. It has no value that Rooney may sap away. There will of course be those who argue that friendlies have a value because they allow the manager to rotate the team and experiment with youngsters, whose progression Rooney will hold back.

I would remind those people of two things: one, this is but one game. If Gareth Southgate, who is at least publicly on board with Rooney’s big moment, was going to judge a youngster on one international friendly against a nation which did not even qualify for the World Cup, he might as well tear up his coaching license. Secondly, and this is apparently a concept which England fans struggle to get their heads around, a friendly is not representative of a competitive fixture. England drew 0-0 with Brazil in November 2017; does anybody seriously suggest that such a thing would occur at the World Cup? Where Brazil cruised past the group and finished quarter-finalists after losing to a very respectable Belgium side, England progressed to the semi-finals by making a mountain of Colombia and were carried by Harry Kane’s ability to score from twelve yards. Such a contrast is evident in club football too: Liverpool thrashed Napoli 5-0 in pre-season, yet found themselves losing 1-0 in the Champions League group stage with a performance that frankly deserved a cricket score. If friendlies were a serious reflection of a team’s quality then people would probably pay attention to them. They should not even be considered caps.

Leaving that aside, even in a competitive environment the England cap is worth a pittance. That Danny Welbeck has commanded a place in the squad at all is proof of this. He was not good enough for Manchester United and he is not good enough now for Arsenal. How can he then be called up so consistently for the England squad, ahead of strikers who know how to score goals? That he has performed well for England is irrelevant, he should never have been called up in the first place. Ben Chilwell, who has performed admirably at left-back for Leicester, was left behind Danny Rose, who was frozen out of the Spurs squad for most of the season, and Ashley Young, a thirty-something year-old right-footed former winger playing in the worst Manchester United side in recent memory. That is not to say that Rose and Young are bad players, but their form and position should have been red flags. If the argument is that Southgate is trying to change a culture and stop the devaluing of the England cap, then it must follow that it has never been worth less, and the last few squads support this. 

In short, there has never been a more appropriate time to say goodbye to Rooney. In a deadwood fixture at a time when the England cap is rising from its lowest ebb, Southgate’s revolution can now set sail at full speed, with its final anchor let loose.",football,dkpetersen26,11,2019-07-05

217,"Theory about how the expensiveness of transfers, past and present, should be calculated","Instead of just using the numerical value to compare transfers from the past to the present, there should be a standard deviation system for each era of similar transfer valuations.

So for example the standard deviation system of this era should have a domain from [500*-250,000,000]*.

The standard deviation system of 2013-2017 should have a domain from [250-100,000,000]*.

*Estimated values

The main goal of this is that low league, amateur players are at the far right of the domain, and the generational players are on the far right.

This way, each transfer will fall in a particular percentile in each standard deviation system. This could measure how expensive or cheap the transfer was in comparison to other transfers in that time period.

So for example, even if Aaron Wan Bissaka at 50 mil cost more than Zidane who cost 46 mil. Zidane was more “expensive” because he had a higher percentile score in his era than Aaron Wan bissaka has in this one.

This algorithm would help make transfer valuation comparisons between different eras more accurate",football,DonkeySkin334,1,2019-07-05

So the whole Messi vs CONMEBOL saga is a bit of weird to me and I'd like to share my view about it all. 

I am a Barcelona fan, but I think Messi is getting it all wrong here. 

He seems to be letting his frustrations on pitch get at him too much (this has always been a weakness of Messi over the year).

At the start of this competition, when his stats weren't that good and blazing efforts over the bar. The captain went ahead to blame the pitch (like he was the only one on it).

Against Brazil, we all know the referee might have gotten it wrong, or NOT.

The call for penalty before the Brazil second goal was not 100%.

Brazil won that game cause they had a plan (Kill Argentina off). And they did that for sure.

Now the third place playoff.

Pitbul and Messi clashed.

Both got a red.

Then boom, Messi comes for CONMEBOL again.",football,forgotmysense,3,2019-07-06

Having won their last four matches in league and cup competitions on the trot, fifth-place Chiangrai United head into their Thai League 1 home fixture confident of extending their run. With 20 goals in the ongoing winning run, they look confident in sustaining a title challenge even as they are deadlocked with three other teams on points prior to kickoff. The same could not be said of eighth-place Nakhon Ratchasima, who have suffered three losses in their last four matches and are deprived of the services of suspended foreign striker Leandro Assumpcao for this match.

More than a week after their domestic cup encounter, Viettel and Ho Chi Minh City once again face off at the same venue, this time in the V.League 1. Last Friday, league leaders Ho Chi Minh needed penalties to see off their spirited opponents in the cup round of 16. Having spent their last two matches needing spot kicks to advance into the cup semi-finals, managing the fatigue of playing extra minutes might be a challenge to the visitors. The hosts’ freshness from their cup elimination might see them make a push to the top half of the league.

288,Can Netherlands beat the USWNT in todays final?,"  

With the Women's World Cup final approaching, let us take a look at how the Netherlands could defeat the USA and cause an upset for the pre-tournament favourites.

The USWNT will not be taking the Netherlands lightly even though the European Champions are underdogs. The Netherlands are the first team ranked outside the top 4 by FIFA to reach a world cup final since Brazil(2007) and the lowest ranked team to play in the final since the FIFA World rankings were introduced in 2003.

The USWNT have a certain pattern of play in this tournament: They try to score early and get an early lead over their opponents so that they can dictate the tempo and make the opponents chase the game. The USWNT’s opening goals in this tournament have come in the 12th, 11th, 3rd, 7th, 5th, and 10th minutes respectively, which shows how reliant they are on this template which is risky as, What would USA do if the first half goes goalless? What would be their game plan? They could be caught off guard in such situations having not previously faced them.

As we know that the USWNT presses their opponents from the very beginning of the game, Netherlands will have to find a way out of the press, traps and the man-marking. To do so they will have to play a fast game with quick passing and smart movements on and off the ball to free up spaces to progress the ball. To break a press you will require brave movement from the midfielders along with non-static wingers.

The Netherlands can be lethal during set pieces. Sherida Spitse is an excellent set-piece taker who is able to deliver highly-accurate balls into the box. With players such as Bloodworth, van der Gragt and Miedema who are excellent at headers and are always positioned well inside the box during an indirect free-kick situation or corners, the Netherlands have a huge advantage as well as a decent chance to score.

The USWNT is athletically dominant and generally lines up in a narrow 4-3-3. The forward line usually formed by Alex Morgan,Megan Rapinoe and Tobin Heath is good at cutting inside the box and is extremely pacy. The USA front three are good at creating space for themselves as well as the midfielders. This will cause problems for the oppositions defense due to the numeric overload formed.

With the US having a well structured attacking and defensive organisation,the Netherlands need to adapt suitably to USA's tactics and prevent the USWNT from getting too comfortable in this game. The Netherlands could do this by not conceding a goal in the first 20 minutes which could change the trajectory of this game.

The USWNT are the clear favourites due to the quality of the players and the tremendous depth they possess. With players such as Megan Rapione,Julie Ertz and Alex Morgan who can completely change the dynamic of this game, the Netherlands will have to be completely focused and flexible in their approach. 

Netherlands can surely win this final with a little bit of luck and if they play to their strengths with passion,awareness and vigor.",football,adiii_,29,2019-07-07
290,Outsider Question: Why has England underperformed so badly in international football?,"Genuine question. Not trying to start shit. Not related to the whole teacup thing in the US-ENG game. I’m Finnish, much more of a hockey fan so I have zero horses in this race.

I rarely watch football so the sport is a bit foreign to me, but I have noticed how surprisingly poorly England seems to perform at major tournaments.

Why is this? England invented the sport and has *the* strongest football heritage of any country. The sport is massively popular there. All of this would kind of logically lead me to think that they’d be a major force at basically every tournament, but this does not seem to happen.

Of course, my perspective is that of a hockey fan. In international hockey, you’ve got the big six nations and a few others that are getting better and better. Football is way more popular and as such the number of real contender countries is much larger.

Anyway, give me your theories! Thank you",football,goatamon,17,2019-07-07

White's beautiful goal vs Sweden in the 3rd place game that was also called back by VAR was not a handball in my opinion. Instead being an amazing display of control I think.

They said that the massive influx of money from the cocaine cartels resulted in a huge leap in the quality of Colombian football.  After the demise of Carlos Escobar the money dried up an the program never recovered.  While all that may be true I don't see how a country can go from second or third tier to the top in less than a generation, and I don't understand why the quality of play would drop so precipitously.  There are other less developed countries like Nigeria and Brazil that have very strong football traditions and consistently field quality teams.  Conversely the United States is about three generations in and has a large population but their international football play is second tier at best.

Basically it just doesn't make sense to me that Colombia could rise just because they had the funds.  Sure they could hire foreign coaches and improve the facilities but that doesn't impact the pipeline of talent that is 10 or 20 years in the making.

To me, this is the transitional World Cup that mixes the traditional 20th century football with the modern, stylish soccer we all know. It's quite underrated as well, given that it had plenty of moments to remember by, such as Maradona being suspended for failing a doping test; Bulgaria eliminating defending champions Germany; the massive success of the USA as host in both audience and financial aspects, in spite of criticism; and finally, Baggio's missed penalty that gave Brazil their fourth title.",football,PresClintDempsey,9,2019-06-17

49,1989 Football team vs 2019 team?,"Now, this question can be better expressed this way: How far back in time can we go and make matchup of legendary/classic teams before the old timers become to slow, lacking in tactics and endurance? 

This question stems from an article I read the other night: Guardiola's peak Barcelona from 2009 squared against Arrigo Sacchi's Milan from 1989. 

The writers had the face off as a  classic Champions League match in which both teams had the chance to play as locals in their own stadiums. Differences in  rulesets from each time period were taken into account, and Milan came up as victorious by one goal, winning 1-0 as locals and losing 1-2 as visitors, taking advantage of the visitor's goal rule.

Now, the issue I take with the articla is that it didn't really take into account the physical differences among both teams. Players from the late 2000's enjoyed huge advances in sports medicine, conditioning and nutrition players from previous decades lacked. When watching a football game from Maradona's time, while I appreciate  everything, I can't but notice how much faster football has become in 30 years. It's kinda similar to how F1 fans were in awe at how much faster the v10 cars from 2004 were than those of Senna's time. 
Now, if the Milanese players were given prep time for conditioning, that's a different matter. I still wonder how much tactics may have advanced since then. Football is becoming so physical that I think that even a team from the early 2000's would have it quite hard to beat a modern twam.

What are your opinions on this subject?",football,AidenMetallist,6,2019-06-18

The length of football pitch must be between 90m (100 yards) and (130 yards) 120m and the not less than 45m (50 yards) and more than 90 m (100). The Fifa’s pitch measurements for an 11-a-side pitch and those number being the professional of the world football.

340,I want to become a football fan: where do I start?,"Context: As a little kid I played football (I live in America so forgive me if I use the word soccer, hope that doesn't offend) and freaking loved it. In Middle and High school, I moved around a lot and didn't get to play anymore and my interest faded. Now though I am an adult and I live in a city that has two Soccer clubs, one being an amazing team that is one of if not the best in my region and the other being a brand new one that's only been around a few months. The brand new one is actually having a training stadium constructed less than five minutes from my work.
I really want to get back into the sport as a fan so that I can show support to the local teams and maybe find a new passion. I am very out of the loop on trends and official language and stuff like that and I don't want to show up to a game or a fan meet-up and have no idea what I am talking about or looking at. Are there any like 'football for beginners' or 'football news' channels on youtube or podcast or anything like that I can use to kinda familiarize myself?",football,Natekt,0,2019-06-24

And Colombia that also finish 1 is gonna play against a much stronger Chile (second in their group). For Columbia finishing 1 or 2 was kinda irrelevant since both play against a team that finish 2. Can someone help me and tel me what is the criteria here?
